In comparison, the company sells its H20 GPUs for 10,000-12,000 each.NVIDIA on Wednesday saidit had incurred a 4.5 billion chargein Q1 due to licensing requirements impacting its ability to sell its H20 AI chip to companies in China, and it couldnt ship an additional 2.5 billion of H20 chips in the quarter due to the restrictions. The company forecast that licensing requirements would result in an 8 billion hit to the companys revenue in Q2.",

That round brought the startups total fundraising to 78.5 million and was aimed to expand its RD, channel presence, and team of engineers, co-founder CEO Snehal Antani told TechCrunch at the time.Founded in 2019, Horizon3.ai comprises a team of former U.S. Special Operations cyber operators, entrepreneurs, and cybersecurity experts. Before launching the startup, Antani served as CTO at Splunk and led teams within the U.S. Militarys Joint Special Operations Command.With all things AI being deployed across the tech world, AI-powered automated attacks are alsoon the rise. The San Francisco-based startup Horizon3.ai helps protect against such attacks with its autonomous threat detection tools.Earlier this month, Horizon3.aireceived FedRAMP authorization, enabling it to sell its wares to federal agencies.

This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government.But without support across the aisle, these efforts to mitigate Trumps ethically suspicious crypto investment are unlikely to gain momentum.With the U.S. government on its side, bitcoins price has jumped to all-time highs in May, breaking the 110,000 mark after falling to around 75,000 in April.

Powered by digital bankGrasshopper, Karats banking product is a natural extension of its credit card offering with Visa.Six years in, the problem were solving is still the same, co-founder and co-CEO Eric Wei told TechCrunch. Creators are real businesses, and banks dont understand them.Despite their prominent position in culture, creators still encounter hiccups when doing simple things like applying for a business credit card or opening up a bank account, even when their businesses are booming.In some cases, Wei has seen creators who make millions of dollars a year get declined when making 100 purchases at department stores. In more ambitious cases, Wei sawWilliam Osman, a creator with over 3 million YouTube subscribers, fail to get the six figures in credit he needed to put on theOpen Sauceconvention.Karat stepped in, gave Osman the credit, and soon got paid back.This was a no-brainer, but a normal institution just does not understand the nature of their business, Wei said.To date, Karat has extended 1.5 billion in credit, with the average credit limit per creator at 25,000. But creators needed more financial services beyond the Karat Visa.Techcrunch eventSave now through June 4 for TechCrunch Sessions: AISave 300 on your ticket to TC Sessions: AIand get 50 off a second.

Wei said. Were also working with entrepreneurs who are like, Why is this so hard for me to get proper treatment from a bank?Image Credits:Karat FinancialFor business banking, Karat offers two tiers  one is a free, FDIC-insured business checking account with automated tax planning (most creators are independent contractors, so they have to prepare more intentionally for their tax payments than if they had a more traditional full-time job).The premium offering costs 20 per month or requires a 35,000 minimum balance, but provides 2 to 3 APY on checking accounts, free wires, and enhanced customer support, with AI bookkeeping coming soon.We know creators actually keep a lot of money in their checking account because the industry is so unstable, so we pay meaningful APY on checking, which most banks actually dont do, Wei said. We have to balance that with knowledge on the banking side of working with a banking partner and helping them understand, Oh, these are really valuable creators and customers to bring on.In the future, Karat hopes to continue this trajectory of offering more and more business services for creators that traditional institutions are reluctant to provide. A possible avenue could be offering various types of insurance to creators, including healthcare for their companies.Were basically trying to reconstruct the financial safety net for people who make money themselves, said Wei.",

Soon, Spotify will also roll out new tools for podcast creators to recommend content and better engage with their fans in comments.The changes, while relatively minor, are a part of Spotifys growing efforts to compete with Apples Podcasts app and YouTube. The latter has been investing more heavily in podcasts in recent years. This month, for instance, YouTube launched itsown weekly top podcast listto challenge Spotify and Apple. That chart highlights somemajor differences between the platformsin terms of what YouTubes video viewers prefer to watch.Meanwhile, Spotify has also invested in video podcasts,allowing all creators to upload videoandincentivizing them with paymentsfor successful showsthrough its Partner Program.Despite these efforts, YouTube remains the service to beat in the U.S., at least, where one-third of weekly podcast listeners prefer the Google-owned service to Spotify or Apple.Spotify says the new podcast recommendations on the Home tab have already started to roll out to global users, and early feedback suggests its led to more users engaging with podcasts, saving, and liking shows.In addition, Spotify is introducing a Following feed that will serve as a dedicated spot where you can see all the latest episodes released by the podcasts you follow, instead of having to search across the app. (To access this feature, youll tap on the Podcasts button at the top of the app, then the Following button that appears to its right.)Techcrunch eventSave now through June 4 for TechCrunch Sessions: AISave 300 on your ticket to TC Sessions: AIand get 50 off a second.

On Wednesday, Life360 announced that the item-finding capabilities of Tile, a competitor to Apples AirTag and other Bluetooth-based trackers, are now available from inside its main app.The update means users will now be able to see where family members are in real time, as well as their valuables, like their wallet, keys, bags, and other items. The change will also help to centralize the separate user bases for the two apps by pushing Tiles users to adopt the Life360 app as their main tracking tool.A company representative told TechCrunch that the integrated services will begin rolling out on Wednesday and will reach all users over the next few weeks.As the rollout progresses, Tile users will soon see a message in their app directing them to Life360, while Life360 users will see a new section for tracking their items below the people and pets section on the Location tab of the app.Tiles that are with a Life360 family member will also appear on the in-app map in real time. If an item is lost, users can view up to two days of location history for free. Subscription plan users can access longer periods of location history, with Gold and Platinum users able to see 30 days, while Silver members can access the past seven days. Silver members also now have access to emergency dispatch services through the Tile SOS button or the Life360 app. (This works with the 2024 Tile devices only, however.)In addition, Life360 users will soon be able to receive automatic push notifications when their items attached to Tile devices are left behind.

But after Tile functionality is fully replicated in Life360s app, it may no longer make sense to continue to run both applications. (Reached for comment, a spokesperson said the Tile app is not being retired at this time.)Life360 had saidback in2022that it would integrate Tile into its main app, noting at the time that if all its Life360 users joined Tile, it would become the largest finding network. But that opportunity may have passed, given the delay in integrating the services. Plus, competitors likeChipolo have since launched their own lost-item trackersthat work directly with both Apple and Googles own built-in finding networks out of the box.Life360 doesnt share the number of users for its Tile app, but notes that its flagship product has 83.7 million global monthly active users, 45.3 million of whom are based in the U.S.Family locator service Life360 to acquire Tile for 205 million",

After gaining unauthorized administrative control of the devices, the threat actor installs a public encryption key for access to the device through SSH. From then on, anyone with the private key can automatically log in to the device with administrative system rights.Durable controlThe attackers access survives both reboots and firmware updates, giving them durable control over affected devices, researchers from security firm GreyNoisereported Wednesday. The attacker maintains long-term access without dropping malware or leaving obvious traces by chaining authentication bypasses, exploiting a known vulnerability, and abusing legitimate configuration features.GreyNoise said it has tracked roughly 9,000 devices around the world that have been backdoored in the ongoing campaign. That number continues to grow. Company researchers said they have no indication that the threat actor has deployed the infected devices in any activity. Rather, the hacks appear to be the beginning stages of the threat actor amassing a large number of compromised devices for future use.GreyNoise said it detected the campaign in mid-March and held off reporting on it until after the company notified unnamed government agencies. That detail further suggests that the threat actor may have some connection to a nation-state.The company researchers went on to say that the activity they observed was part of a larger campaignreported last weekby fellow security company Sekoia. Researchers at Sekoia said that Internet scanning by network intelligence firm Censys suggested as many as9,500 Asus routersmay have been compromised ViciousTrap, the name used to track the unknown threat actor.The attackers are backdooring the devices by exploiting multiple vulnerabilities. One is CVE-2023-39780, a command injection flaw that allows for the execution of system commands, which Asus patched in a recent firmware update, GreyNoise said. The remaining vulnerabilities have also been patched, but have not received CVE tracking designations for unknown reasons.The only way for router users to determine whether their devices are infected is by checking the SSH settings in the configuration panel. Infected routers will show that the device can be logged into by SSH over port 53282 using a digital certificate with a truncated key ofssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAo41nBoVFfj4HlVMGVYPsxMDrMlbdDZ...To remove the backdoor, infected users should remove the key and the port setting.People can also determine if theyve been targeted if system logs indicate that they have been accessed through the IP addresses 101.99.91[.]151, 101.99.94[.]173, 79.141.163[.]179, or 111.90.146[.]237.

The partnership dates back to 2022, part of a wide-ranging agreement that also saw Stellantis pick Amazon Web Services as its cloud platform for new vehicles and Amazon sign on as the first customer for Ram's fully electric ProMaster EV van.A key aspect of the Amazon-Stellantis partnership was to be a software platform for new Stellantis vehicles called STLA SmartCockpit. Meant to debut last year, SmartCockpit was supposed to \"seamlessly integrate with customers digital lives to create personalized, intuitive in-vehicle experiences,\" using Alexa and other AI agents to provide better in-car entertainment but also navigation, vehicle maintenance, and in-car payments as well.But 2024 came and went without the launch of SmartCockpit, and now the joint work has wound down,according to Reuters, although not for any particular reason the news organization could discern. Rather, the companies said in a statement that they \"will allow each team to focus on solutions that provide value to our shared customers and better align with our evolving strategies.\"Stellantis continues to work with Amazon in other areasStellantis isn't migrating away from AWS anytime soon that we know, and Amazon provides the Fire TVs that are an option on Chrysler's Pacifica minivan. More broadly, Amazon has been placing Alexa inside the infotainment systems of dozens of OEMs as it competes with other tech giants to claim a slice of vehicles' digital footprint.Amazon Fire TVs are still an option for the back seat of the Pacifica.Credit: StellantisBut Amazon is still a minor player compared to its rivals. Google's Android Automotive OS is now built into hundreds of new models, including all Stellantis vehicles that ship with uConnect 5. And many more use more modified Android-based OSes.

Ten years on, Google Photos remains one of Google's most popular products, and it's getting a couple of new features to celebrate its 10th year in operation. You'll be able to share albums a bit more easily, and editing tools are getting a boost with, you guessed it, AI.Google Photos made a splash in 2015 when itbroke freeof the spiraling Google social network, offering people supposedly unlimited free storage for compressed images. Of course, that was too good to last. In 2021, Googlebegan limiting photo uploadsto 15GB for free users, sharing the default account level storage with other services like Gmail and Drive. Today, Google encourages everyone to pay for a Google One subscription to get more space, which is a bit of a bummer. Regardless, people still use Google Photos extensively.According to the company, Photos has more than 1.5 billion monthly users, and it stores more than 9 trillion photos and videos. When using the Photos app on a phone, you are prompted to automatically upload your camera roll, which makes it easy to keep all your memories backed up (and edge ever closer to the free storage limit). Photos has also long offered almost magical search capabilities, allowing you to search for the content of images to find them. That may seem less impressive now, but it was revolutionary a decade ago. Google says users perform over 370 million searches in Photos each month.An AI anniversaryGoogle islocked in with AIas it reimagines most of its products and services with Gemini. As it refreshes Photos for its 10th anniversary, the editor is getting a fresh dose of AI. And this may end up one of Google's most used AI featuresmore than 210 million images are edited in Photos every month.Google says the new Photos editor uses AI to make \"helpful suggestions\" for your pics, and it has been redesigned to put all the editing tools in one place. AI in the app can suggest multiple edits in one go to changeand hopefully improveyour images. You can also tap or circle specific parts of an image to get tool suggestions for that area.That's not all. The new editor will add Reimagine and Auto Frame, which were originally exclusive to the Pixel 9 series. Reimagine allows you to select a part of the image and then enter a prompt to change it, remove an object, or add something new with generative AI. Auto Frame does what it sounds likeit adjusts the framing of a photo and uses generative AI to fill in the gaps around your subject.There's one last addition to Photos as it ages into double digits. Thus far, album sharing has been limited to URL links and contacts, a feature that is used over 440 million times per month. In the new update, Google is adding the option to use QR codes. You can display the code on your screen or print it out to give people the ability to view and, if you choose, add images to an album. That could be a fun way to collect and share images from an event or party.Google says the revamped editing update will come to Android devices in June. Sadly, iPhone users will have to wait until \"later this year\" for the new editing tools.Ryan WhitwamSenior Technology ReporterRyan WhitwamSenior Technology ReporterRyan Whitwam is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering the ways Google, AI, and mobile technology continue to change the world.

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.Elon Musks official role within the United States government is coming to an end. The billionaire Tesla CEO announced his White House departurein an X post on Wednesday night, thanking President Donald Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending by leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).The DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government, Musk wrote, saying that his position as a special government employee was coming to an end.Musks departure was expected. He hadannounced plans earlier this monthto step away from government and spend a lot less on US political campaigns, having invested nearly 300 million into Trumps Presidential run. Hes also pledged to spend more time on Tesla, with his controversial political stinthaving likely contributedto the EV makersspiralling sales. The role of special government employee also comes with a 130-day time limit  a deadline that was fast approaching if DOGEs establishment on January 20th is considered Musks start date.A White House officialtoldReutersthat Musk was being off-boarded on Wednesday night. The publication reports that Musk didnt formally discuss his departure with Trump before announcing it on X, and that his exit was decided at a senior staff level.Musk is parting ways with the Trump administration a day after criticizing the Presidents One Big Beautiful Billin an interview with CBS, saying the landmark tax legislation would increase the federal deficit and undermine his cost-cutting efforts at DOGE. During Trumps campaign, Musk initially pledged that DOGE would cut at least 2 trillion in federal spending before later slashing its targets to 1 trillion and then 150 billion. TheDOGE websitecurrently claims to have saved 175 billion, but that figure should be taken with a fistful of saltgiven previous exaggerations.See More:Elon MuskNewsPolicyPoliticsTechMost PopularMost PopularApple is reportedly going to rename all of its operating systemsTesla continues to circle the drainUS will ban foreign officials to punish countries for social media rulesThe plan for nationwide fiber internet might be upended for StarlinkSamsungs One UI 8 beta arrives on Galaxy S25 phonesInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verges universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native ad",

Once its installed, you can now toggle the ability to stream HDR video option even when HDR is disabled in Windows, allowing you to view HDR content from apps like Netflix or websites like YouTube without having to enable HDR throughout Windows.Microsoft is also updating Windows 11s HDR support to allow you to independently toggle Dolby Vision support in content or throughout Windows. Dolby Vision used to be forced on inside Windows if you enabled it on your monitor, so its nice to have the option to be able to toggle it on or off.These new options are great for people who simply disable HDR in Windows because of its patchy support. I personally disable HDR in Windows and use the keyboard shortcut (Windows Key  Alt  B) to enable it in games that properly support it, simply because I rely on a variety of content capture tools for screenshots and screen recording that produce a washed out image because they dont properly support HDR or provide a way to capture individual SDR content.While HDR support in Windows has improved over the past year thanks to the latest batch of OLED monitors, Id still like to see game developers and Microsoft take HDR more seriously.Auto HDR is great for games, but its still a really fiddly and manual process to get HDR to work well across a variety of apps and games in Windows.See More:MicrosoftNewsTechWindowsMost PopularMost PopularApple is reportedly going to rename all of its operating systemsTesla continues to circle the drainUS will ban foreign officials to punish countries for social media rulesThe plan for nationwide fiber internet might be upended for StarlinkSamsungs One UI 8 beta arrives on Galaxy S25 phonesInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verges universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native ad",

The DMA requires that Apple allow developers to inform their customers about sales or other offers outside the App Store.In the68-page documentreleased today from the EC's April decision, the commission found that Apple's policies were plainly anti-competitive and said the company added unnecessary hurdles  referred to as \"anti-steering\" rules  to completing external transactions.One such anti-steering strategy the EC took umbrage with was Apple's \"scare sheets.\" When users clicked to navigate to an external payment link, a message would appear, reading youre about to go to an external website. Apple is not responsible for the privacy or security of purchases made on the web. Apple could face heftyperiodic penalty paymentsas high as five percent of daily global revenue if the company doesnt bring its policies into compliance within the EU.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementIn astatement to9to5Mac, Apple expressed its disappointment with the newly released details, saying there is nothing in the 70-page decision released today that justifies the European Commissions targeted actions against Apple, which threaten the privacy and security of our users in Europe and force us to give away our technology for free.\" Later in the statement, the company called the decision \"bad for innovation, bad for competition, bad for our products, and bad for users.\"Apple will appeal the decision before the June 22 deadline laid out in the EC's decision.",

First, thestreaming serviceis putting a Following feed in the main Podcasts area on the Home screen. With this toggle, you can quickly see what's new from the shows you subscribe to. The company says the goal here is to eliminate the need to search for fresh content from podcasts you follow, and it pledges it will \"continue to explore new ways to make this space even better.\" And just below shortcuts on the Home screen, Spotify will start displaying podcast recommendations, complete with a note as to why the algorithm picked it for you.Next, Spotify plans to roll out an \"In this episode\" section for podcast pages. Here, you'll find links to other shows, songs, audiobooks, playlists and more than hosts mention or recommend. Creators will have the ability to link those items as they see fit, so you won't have to go looking for them later.Lastly, the company is givingpodcast commentsa slight refresh. Based on user feedback, Spotify is introducing threaded replies and emoji reactions for creators. This will all still be controlled via Spotify for Creators where they can also control if comments are available for their show or specific episodes.",

    "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang tiptoed into politics with a comment taking a shot at theU.S. policythat has cut off sales of his chips to China.That was because Nvidia had to take a 4.5 billion charge against its Q1 earnings because the company had to immediately cease selling H20 AI chips to China in April. U.S. President Donald Trump imposed the restrictions as part of the trade war over tariffs with China and other countries.Let me share my perspective on some topics were frequently asked on export control. China is one of the worlds largest AI markets and a springboard to global success with half of the worlds AI researchers based there, Huang said. The platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally today. However, the 50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry. The H20 export ban ended our Hopper data center business in China. We cannot produce Hopper further to comply. As a result, we are taking a multibillion-dollar write-off on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed. We are exploring limited ways to compete, but hopper is no longer an option.Huang said that, with or without U.S. chips, China has to compute to train and deploy advanced models.The question is not whether China will have it. It already does, he said. The question is whether one of the worlds largest AI markets will run on American platforms. Shielding Chinese chip makers from U.S. competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens Americas position.He added, Export restrictions have spurred Chinas competitiveness. He said, The race is not just about chips. Its about which stack the world runs as that stack grows. Global infrastructure leadership is at stake. The U.S. has based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make any chips. That assumption was always questionable, and now its very wrong. China has enormous manufacturing capability. In the end, the platform that wins the AI developers wins AI. AI export controls should strengthen U.S. platforms, not drive half the worlds AI talent to other shores.While Huang was critical of policy changes, he also said, Its really terrific to see the AI diffusion rule was rescinded. President Trump wants America to win and realizes we are not the only country in the race. And he realizes we have to get the American stack out to the world.Huang was referencing the Biden-era AI Diffusion Rule, which was rescinded in May 2025, just before it was set to take effect. Bidens administration aimed to place export controls on AI model weights and advanced computing integrated circuits (ICs), potentially restricting the global diffusion of AI technology.But the Trump administration argued that the rule would stifle American AI innovation.The rescission of the AI Diffusion Rule could potentially benefit countries like Saudi Arabia and U.S. AI companies by easing restrictions on AI technology exports. However, the Trump administration indicated they would pursue a strategy to promote American AI technology with trusted allies, while still aiming to block access to adversaries.Huang said, The president has a plan. He has a vision. And I trust him. But he added, The new limits are the end of the road for Hopper.GB DailyStay in the know!

But thats all changing this year.We already know thatAndroid 16will roll out soon, with June looking likely, while theSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7and theSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7will probably launch in July. So that makes it viable for them to launch with Android 16 out of the box, but until today we werent certain that would happen, since Samsung still needs time to make its own software modifications.However, the company hasnow confirmedthat these phones will ship with Android 16, which is likely to make them among the first handsets to run Android 16 out of the box.Android 16 on a Samsung phone(Image credit: Samsung)Faster than normalThis is slightly surprising since Samsung can often be slow to update its handsets, but the company claims this was achieved through open communication and real-time feedback with Google.Specifically, youll be getting One UI 8 on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7. This is Samsungs customized take on Android 16, and  as you might have guessed  it puts a lot of focus on AI.That said, Samsung also highlights security and convenient, intuitive tools like allowing you to connect to Bluetooth audio devices effortlessly by scanning a QR code.Of course, you wont have to buy one of Samsungs upcoming foldables to get Android 16 and One UI 8  the company has alreadylaunched a One UI 8 beta on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, so those devices will also probably get access to the finished version of this software soon after its available.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsYou might also likeThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 has been benchmarked, and the results are extremely disappointingThe Samsung Galaxy S26 could get a much-needed new cameraThe Samsung Galaxy S25 FE cameras have leaked, and theyre utterly underwhelmingSee more News about PhonesJames RogersonJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

According to a recent report, it looks like there will only be two models making their debut: theSamsung Galaxy Watch 8and a Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.The Samsung Galaxy Watch Classic series takes the standard Galaxy Watch line and adds a dive watch-style rotating bezel, which also serves as a way to engage with the watch's UI outside of the buttons and touch screens.As spotted byXpertPick, the Chinese telecomms certification board CMIIT has passed two devices labeled SM-L3350 and SM-L5050, believed to be the Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic. It appears they'll both launch in July 2025around the time of Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event.The report follows previous news that generation eight of the Samsung Galaxy Watch linecould bring back the Classic form factor.

It includes the console itself, a digital copy ofMarioKart World,and a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online  Expansion Pack subscription.Stock could obviously vary depending on your location, but the webpage states that the Switch 2 \"is expected to be in stock and available for purchase soon\" and urges shoppers to \"check back again later.\"There is, however, still no sign thatNintendo Switch 2 pre-orderswill be available at CostCo. Furthermore, the retailer is limiting purchases to one unit every seven days. But after a week, it's realistic to expect Switch 2 stock to sell through entirely at CostCo given how difficult it has been to already secure a pre-order.As for price, CostCo hasn't disclosed this quite yet. But if I had to guess, given the addition of a 12-month NSO  Expansion Pack membership on top of the 499.99Mario Kart Worldbundle, I'd expect this bundle to go on sale for around 549.99.Likely not the most affordable bundle out there, then, but certainly one worth considering if you'd like a Switch 2 console on day one, and are running out of options elsewhere.You might also like...Nintendo has updated its Switch 2 game compatibility page, identifying over 100 titles with 'start up issues' on the upcoming consoleCheck your Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order ASAP, as some retailers are reportedly cancelling themPowerA reveals new line of Nintendo Switch 2 accessories including a wired controller with Hall effect thumbsticksGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsRhys WoodHardware EditorRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for more than two years.

The temptation to try the latest AI tool can lead to anyone becoming a victim. We advise users to exercise caution when engaging with AI tools and to verify the legitimacy of the website's domain.Be sure to thoroughly vet any adverts on social media, and manually search any software deals into a search engine before downloading anything in order to properly verify the source.Are you a pro?

It also contained code associated with open source post-exploitation framework SilentTrinity and StormKitty stealer.VenomRAT is a lightweight RAT that cybercriminals use to gain control over compromised Windows systems.

    "link": "https://desktopdocs.com/?v=2025",
    "summary": "<p>A year ago, my co-founder launched Desktop Docs here on HN. It's a Mac app we built with Electron that uses CLIP embeddings to search photos and videos locally with natural language. We got positive feedback from HN and our first paying customers, but the app was almost 1GB and clunky to use.<p>TLDR; rebuilding in Rust was the right move.<p>So we rewrote the app with Rust and Tauri and here are the results:<p>- App size is 83% smaller: 1GB → 172MB\n- DMG Installer is 70% smaller: 232MB → 69.5MB\n- Indexing files is faster: A 38-minute video now indexes in ~3 minutes instead of 10-14 minutes\n- Overall more stability (old app used to randomly crash)<p>The original version worked, but it didn't perform well when you tried indexing thousands of images or large videos. We lost a lot of time struggling to optimize Electron’s main-renderer process communication and ended up with a complex worker system to process large batches of media files.<p>For months we wrestled with indecision about continuing to optimize the Electron app vs. starting a full rebuild in Swift or Rust. The main thing holding us back was that we hadn’t coded in Swift in almost 10 years and we didn’t know Rust very well.<p>What finally broke us was when users complained the app crashed their video calls just running in background. I guess that’s what happens when you ship an app with Chromium that takes up 200mb before any application code.<p>Today the app still uses CLIP for embeddings and Redis for vector storage and search, except Rust now handles the image and video processing pipeline and all the file I/O to let users browse their entire machine, not just indexed files.<p>For the UI, we decided to rebuild it from scratch instead of porting over the old UI. This turned out well because it resulted in a cleaner, simpler UI after living with the complexity of the old version.<p>The trickiest part of the migration was learning Rust. LLMs definitely help, but the Rust/Tauri community just isn’t as mature compared to Electron. Bundling Redis into the app was a permissioning nightmare, but I think our solution with Rust handles this better than what we had with Electron.<p>All in, the rebuild took about two months and still needs some more work to be at total parity with its Electron version, but the core functionality of indexing and searching files is way more performant than before and that made it worth the time. Sometimes you gotta throw away working code to build the right thing.<p>AMA about Rust/Tauri migration, Redis bundling nightmares, how CLIP embeddings work for local semantic search, or why Electron isn't always the answer.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44118023\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44118023</a></p>\n<p>Points: 518</p>\n<p># Comments: 368</p>",

Credit: Chimbo Foundation.A recent study by behavioral biologists from Wageningen University  Research and the German Primate Research Center has uncovered a remarkable phenomenon among wild chimpanzees in West Africa: the use of stones to produce sound, presumably as a form of communication.Over the course of a five-year field study, the research team collectedvideo footageat five distinct locations within anature reservein Guinea-Bissau. This was made possible through the use of camera traps and with essential support from local field guides. In specific areas, a striking behavioral pattern was observed: adult male chimpanzees repeatedly struck stones againsttree trunks, resulting in characteristic piles of stones at the base of these trees.The study ispublishedin the journalBiology Letters.Lead author Sem van Loon refers to this behavior as \"stone-assisted drumming.\" \"It appears to be related to the classic drumming with hands or feet on hollow buttress roots, which chimpanzees use to convey information over long distances or to display dominance,\" she explains.Yet there are clear differences: prior to throwing stones, the animals are more likely to emit loud pant-hoots, followed by silencean opposite pattern to traditional drumming, where silence typically precedes the noise.Van Loon suspects a different motivation behind this behavior. \"It may be that these loud, low-frequency sounds are meant to carry further than typical within-group communication,\" she suggests. \"The acoustic properties of a stone striking a tree make that feasible in densely forested areas.\"The observations point to cultural transmission. Young chimpanzees adopt the behavior from older group members, indicating that it is learned socially rather than genetically inherited.Marc Naguib, Professor of Behavioral Ecology, underscores the broader significance of the discovery: \"It illustrates that culture is not unique to humans and that such behaviors need to be considered also in nature conservation.\"More information:Sem van Loon et al, Stone-assisted drumming in Western chimpanzees and its implications for communication and cultural transmission,Biology Letters(2025).DOI: 10.1098rsbl.2025.0053Journal information:Biology LettersProvided byWageningen UniversityCitation: Five-year study suggests chimpanzees strike stones against trees as form of communication (2025, May 26) retrieved 29 May 2025 from https:phys.orgnews2025-05-year-chimpanzees-stones-trees-communication.htmlThis document is subject to copyright.

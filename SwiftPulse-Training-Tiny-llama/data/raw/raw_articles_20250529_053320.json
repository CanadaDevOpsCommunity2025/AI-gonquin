In comparison, the company sells its H20 GPUs for $10,000-$12,000 each.NVIDIA on Wednesday saidit had incurred a $4.5 billion chargein Q1 due to licensing requirements impacting its ability to sell its H20 AI chip to companies in China, and it couldn’t ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 chips in the quarter due to the restrictions. The company forecast that licensing requirements would result in an $8 billion hit to the company’s revenue in Q2.",

    "content": "Home services in India — whether it is cleaning, dishwashing, or laundry — have traditionally been offline and informally run. This has often resulted in delays and uncertainties for consumers, as well as inconsistent pay and job insecurity for workers. Recently, however, startups havebegun viewing this area as ripe for transformation, leveraging technology to bring predictability, scalability, and structure to the space.Snabbit, founded last year, is one of the early movers in this arena, enabling customers to book high-frequency home services, including cleaning, dishwashing, laundry, and kitchen preparation, through its app, with delivery as fast as 10 minutes. The startup has now raised $19 million in a Series B round led by Lightspeed, with participation from its existing investors Elevation Capital and Nexus Venture Partners, at a post-money valuation of $80 million to expand its presence.The 15-month-old startup launched its quick-service platform in the western Indian city of Mumbai, the country’s financial capital, after founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal personally experienced the challenges of finding reliable home services. At one point, Agarwal told TechCrunch, the situation became so difficult that his mother had to fly in from the eastern Indian city of Kolkata to help him find a new domestic worker.“What stayed with me was that in a world of convenience where you can press a button, and you’ll get a cab, or you’ll get food or groceries, you can even get someone to go out on a date with, but finding someone for a simple service at home was excruciatingly difficult,” he said in an interview.The startup ran experiments early last year and remained in one micro market in Mumbai for the first 12 months before expanding to seven markets in the city and one in Bengaluru.Snabbit took a “full-stack approach” to sourcing, screening, training, onboarding, and managing workers, who the startup calls “experts.” Once Snabbit signs them, it has the workers move close to the startup’s demand centers so they can fulfill the company’s promise to provide service in 10 minutes.Snabbit is not alone in this race, as incumbentUrban Company(backed by storied investors, including Accel, Prosus, and Tiger Global)started a similar experienceon its app earlier this year. However, the company faced criticism due to the initial message it conveyed and the name Insta Maids, which it later corrected and renamed to Insta Help. This did not help convince many, including gig worker unions, though.Techcrunch eventSave now through June 4 for TechCrunch Sessions: AISave $300 on your ticket to TC Sessions: AI—and get 50% off a second.

The latter even recently attracted Bain Capital Ventures for its seed funding.“We know that the market is heating up,” he said. “The category is getting exciting, new players are coming in and getting funded. And I think all of it is great for us as long as we keep executing relentlessly.”Image Credits:SnabbitThe startup charges customers between ₹169 (about $2) and ₹499 (nearly $6) to avail services of up to 240 minutes. The pricing is higher than that of Urban Company’s Insta Help, which starts at ₹49 (50 cents). However, Agarwal said the startup continued to grow and scale even after Urban Company’s foray into the market.Agarwal hopes to compete with a consistent customer experience using its in-house tech stack that includes an internal CRM tool, a sourcing and screening pipeline, and an eKYC process to better comply with local regulations.Snabbit currently has over 600 workers on its platform, and each of them covers a median walking distance of 300 meters between two jobs. It has also partnered with the mobility startup Yulu to train and provide e-bikes to its women workers, covering a larger median distance of 800 meters between their jobs. Moreover, Agarwal told TechCrunch that the startup will reduce the median distance for its workers as it scales.The average ticket size on Snabbit’s platform is between ₹250 and ₹270 (about $3), while its workers completing a 12-hour shift earn “upward” of ₹40,000 ($470) a month. For completing four hours a day on the platform, the workers get over ₹10,000 ($120) a month, Agarwal said, adding that workers are also eligible for bonuses.Agarwal contends that workers can earn more than the roughly ₹9,000 ($100) that domestic helpers in urban locations are typically paid in the country,per the International Domestic Workers Federation (PDF).Better treatment for domestic workersSnabbit also provides personal life insurance, health insurance, and accidental insurance to all its workers, as well as family insurance to those who have been with the startup for some time.Workplace abuse has also beenquite prevalent for domestic workers in India, as the countrypredominantly lacks protective laws. For such cases, the startup provides an SOS feature on its app that workers can use to call a field operations team, which reaches the location within “five to seven minutes” to help workers in edge situations, the founder said.Over the last four months, Agarwal stated the startup grew 5x and is currently growing around 20% week-over-week. It plans to expand to over 200 micro markets across metro cities in India within the next nine months by utilizing the fresh capital and hire more employees in its workforce that has nearly 100 people.That said, several hyperlocal consumer apps have been tried and failed repeatedly. For instance, food deliveries imploded globally in 2023 after the pandemic-led lockdowns eased, but they started facing challenges in the last few months. Even in India, instant food delivery models introduced by quick commerce platforms, includingZeptoandZomato, have struggled. The formerpaused its 10-minute cafe services due to supply constraints, while the latterhalted its 15-minute food delivery servicejust four months after launch, citing “no incrementality in demand.”The cost of acquiring customers and providing suppliers in their location is expensive and often hard to pay over time. In Snabbit’s case, TechCrunch has learned that the customer acquisition cost is ₹700 ($8), while its average ticket size is about $3.The startup has onboarded over 25,000 customers so far, and an average customer transacts on the platform at least three times a month, per Agarwal.“Our retention rates are as good as any consumer internet company, say, a Zepto or Swiggy, would be having,” the executive said.Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how the startup can retain its customers over time and beat the competition while continuing to scale and expand its market in India.“Snabbit is transforming home services in India by bringing speed, structure, and trust to a sector that has largely operated informally until now,” said Rahul Taneja, a partner at Lightspeed, in a prepared statement. “We are excited to join them on this journey and support their mission to transform and scale what was once considered a luxury into a day-to-day necessity.”",

    "content": "Sahil Lavingia haspublished a diaryrecounting his time as a member ofElon Musk’s DOGE workforce. It’s a short read — Lavingia’s DOGE stint lasted just 55 days — but it does provide new details on the temporary government organization formed by President Trump’s executive order.Lavingia is a well-known name in Silicon Valley, from his days as an early employee of Pinterest to his current gig as founder ofGumroad,a platform where creators can sell their goods. He’s also awell-known seed and angel investor.He joined DOGE as a software engineer for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in mid-March, he wrote. What stands out from his account is his surprise that the 473,000-employee government agency had strict rules on who could be targeted in a layoff, and he quickly learned that all things at the VA were not as inefficient as he imagined. He also lamented that DOGE itself isn’t a well-oiled machine.As a volunteer who had a salary of $0, he was immediately tasked with identifying “wasteful” contracts and the people the VA should lay off, he wrote. But he was surprised to discover facets like seniority and the person’s veteran status (this was the VA, after all) determined who could be targeted. Performance could be factored in lower on the list, in Lavingia’s view.He also describedDOGE’s advisory roleas like a McKinsey management consultant and said DOGE is not responsible for the actions taken by the orgs. “DOGE had no direct authority. The real decisions came from the agency heads appointed by President Trump, who were wise to let DOGE act as the ‘fall guy’ for unpopular decisions,” he says.This is similar to what Musk was decrying this week to theWashington Post. Musk describedDOGE as Washington, D.C.’s “whipping boy,”blamed for every unpopular decision.Lavingia said he joined DOGE after campaigning for Bernie Sanders in 2016 because he dreamed of writing code for the government that helped people at scale. Because his DOGE missives didn’t take much time, he said he worked on projects that interested him, including overhauling the UX of the VA’s already-in-use LLM-based chatbot.Techcrunch eventSave now through June 4 for TechCrunch Sessions: AISave $300 on your ticket to TC Sessions: AI—and get 50% off a second.

Available through May 9 or while tables last.Berkeley, CA|June 5REGISTER NOWHe said he built a fairly long list of stuff in his less-than-two-month stint but didn’t get a chance to do enormous projects, like “improving the UX of veterans’ filing disability claims or automating/speeding up claims processing.”And, he wrote, “I was never able to get approval to ship anything to production that would actually improve American lives — while also saving money for the American taxpayer.”He was, however, given permission to open source much of his work. His work included a tool that scanned internal PDFs for terms “related to DEI, gender identity, COVID policies, climate initiatives, WHO partnerships,”he describedon the tool’s page, as well as tools that used LLMs to analyze contracts and a tool for building org charts.He also made observations about the lack of organization in DOGE itself. “I wondered why there wasn’t a centralized DOGE software engineering playbook with all of our learnings; overall, I was surprised by the lack of knowledge-sharing within DOGE. It seemed like every engineer started from scratch.”He was unceremoniously axed from DOGE on Day 55 after he discussedhis work there with a reporter from Fast Company. “I got the boot from DOGE,” he wrote. “Soon after publication, my access was revoked without warning.”In that FC interview, however, he also said working up close with the VA taught him that, while it was slow like a giant enterprise, it still “works.”“I would say the culture shock is mostly a lot of meetings, not a lot of decisions,” he says. “But honestly, it’s kind of fine — because the government works. It’s not as inefficient as I was expecting, to be honest. I was hoping for more easy wins.”His experience captures perfectly the dilemma of keeping enormous government agencies modern as they remain functional. While all taxpayers would like less waste, and the government can surely benefit from more programmers immersed in the latest tech, perhaps Silicon Valley volunteers swooping in like they are building a startup from scratch isn’t the answer.Lavingia did not immediately respond to our request for additional comment.",

The chipmaker also reported that it was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the quarter due to the restrictions.When the U.S. licensing requirement was originally announced in April, the companysaid that it expected $5.5 billion in related chargesfor Q1.Nvidia also said Wednesday that the H20 licensing requirements will result in an $8 billion hit to the company’s revenue in Q2, which is predicted to be around $45 billion — a significant toll.In the company’s Q1 earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang said that the company is currently exploring ways to still compete in China’s AI market but that, for now, it has to take a write-off for its H20 chips.“China is one of the world’s largest AI markets and a springboard to global success with half of the world’s AI researchers based there; the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally today,” Huang said. “However, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to us. The H20 export ban ended our Hopper data center business in China.

It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government.”But without support across the aisle, these efforts to mitigate Trump’s ethically suspicious crypto investment are unlikely to gain momentum.With the U.S. government on its side, bitcoin’s price has jumped to all-time highs in May, breaking the $110,000 mark after falling to around $75,000 in April.

For instance, Stellantis will continue to use Amazon Web Services as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms. Amazon’s Alexa will also continue to be available in Stellantis vehicles.Stellantis laid out an ambitious plan in December 2021 to have 34 million connected cars on the road by 2030. The pitch was that Stellantis would be setting itself up for a new stream of revenue beyond building and selling vehicles.Stellantis struck partnerships with BMW, Foxconn, Waymo, and Amazon to reach that target.The plan to use in-car software to sell passengers and drivers products and subscriptions involved three components.Techcrunch eventSave now through June 4 for TechCrunch Sessions: AISave $300 on your ticket to TC Sessions: AI—and get 50% off a second.

DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques,have led Wall Street analysts—and technologists— to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain.But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly?DeepSeek’s trader originsDeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions.AI enthusiastLiang Wenfengco-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms.In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek.From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China,DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies.Techcrunch eventSave now through June 4 for TechCrunch Sessions: AISave $300 on your ticket to TC Sessions: AI—and get 50% off a second.

Available through May 9 or while tables last.Berkeley, CA|June 5REGISTER NOWDeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The companyreportedly aggressively recruitsdoctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities.DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science backgroundto help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times.DeepSeek’s strong modelsDeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice.DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free.DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety.According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’sLlamaand “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’sGPT-4o.Equally impressive is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. Released in January, DeepSeek claimsR1 performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks.Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math.There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek’s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they’re subject tobenchmarkingby China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses “embody core socialist values.” In DeepSeek’s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy.In March,DeepSeek surpassed 16.5 million visits. “[F]or March, DeepSeek is in second place, despite seeing traffic drop 25% from where it was in February, based on daily visits,” David Carr, editor at Similarweb, told TechCrunch. It still pales in comparison to ChatGPT, which surged past 500 million weekly active users in March.In May, DeepSeek released anupdated version of its R1 reasoning AI modelon the developer platform Hugging Face.A disruptive approachIf DeepSeek has a business model, it’s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free.It’s also not taking investor money, despite a ton of VC interest.The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some expertsdisputethe figures the company has supplied, however.Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek’s models, which aren’t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek’s models,developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined.DeepSeek’s success against larger and more established rivals has beendescribed as “upending AI”and“over-hyped.”The company’s success was at least in part responsible forcausing Nvidia’s stock price to drop by 18%in January, and foreliciting a public responsefrom OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In March, U.S. Commerce department bureaus told staffers thatDeepSeek will be banned on their government devices, according to Reuters.Microsoftannounced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft’s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg saidspending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage”for Meta. In March,OpenAI called DeepSeek “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,”and recommends that the U.S. government consider banning models from DeepSeek.During Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings call,CEO Jensen Huang emphasized DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,”saying that it and other “reasoning” models are great for Nvidia because they need so much more compute.At the same time,some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entirecountriesandgovernments,including South Korea. New York state alsobanned DeepSeek from being used on government devices.In May, Microsoft vice chairman and president Brad Smith said in a Senate hearing thatMicrosoft employees aren’t allowed to use DeepSeekdue to data security and propaganda concerns.As for what DeepSeek’s future might hold, it’s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to begrowing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported thatthe U.S. will likely ban DeepSeek on government devices.This story was originally published January 28, 2025, and will be updated regularly.",

Powered by digital bankGrasshopper, Karat’s banking product is a natural extension of its credit card offering with Visa.“Six years in, the problem we’re solving is still the same,” co-founder and co-CEO Eric Wei told TechCrunch. “Creators are real businesses, and banks don’t understand them.”Despite their prominent position in culture, creators still encounter hiccups when doing simple things like applying for a business credit card or opening up a bank account, even when their businesses are booming.In some cases, Wei has seen creators who make millions of dollars a year get declined when making $100 purchases at department stores. In more ambitious cases, Wei sawWilliam Osman, a creator with over 3 million YouTube subscribers, fail to get the six figures in credit he needed to put on theOpen Sauceconvention.Karat stepped in, gave Osman the credit, and soon got paid back.“This was a no-brainer, but a normal institution just does not understand the nature of their business,” Wei said.To date, Karat has extended $1.5 billion in credit, with the average credit limit per creator at $25,000. But creators needed more financial services beyond the Karat Visa.Techcrunch eventSave now through June 4 for TechCrunch Sessions: AISave $300 on your ticket to TC Sessions: AI—and get 50% off a second.

A possible avenue could be offering various types of insurance to creators, including healthcare for their companies.“We’re basically trying to reconstruct the financial safety net for people who make money themselves,” said Wei.",

    "content": "Odyssey, a startup founded by self-driving pioneersOliver CameronandJeff Hawke, has developed an AI model that lets users “interact” with streaming video.Available on the web in an “early demo,” the model generates and streams video frames every 40 milliseconds. Via basic controls, viewers can explore areas within a video, similar to a 3D-rendered video game.“Given the current state of the world, an incoming action, and a history of states and actions, the model attempts to predict the next state of the world,”explains Odyssey in a blog post. “Powering this is a new world model, demonstrating capabilities like generating pixels that feel realistic, maintaining spatial consistency, learning actions from video, and outputting coherent video streams for 5 minutes or more.”Introducing AI video you can watch and interact with, in real-time!Powering this is a new world model that imagines and streams video frames every 40ms(!). No game engine in sight.We call it interactive video, and it's free for anyone to try right now (GPUs permitting)!pic.twitter.com/QtADRXCQ8z— Odyssey (@odysseyml)May 28, 2025A number of startups and Big Tech companies are chasing afterworld models, includingDeepMind, influential AI researcher Fei-Fei Li’sWorld Labs,Microsoft, andDecart. They believe that world models could one day be used to create interactive media, such as games and movies, and run realistic simulations like training environments for robots.But creatives have mixed feelings about the tech. ArecentWired investigation found that game studios like Activision Blizzard, which has laid off scores of workers, are using AI to cut corners and combat attrition. And a 2024studycommissioned by the Animation Guild, a union representing Hollywood animators and cartoonists, estimated that over 100,000 U.S.-based film, television, and animation jobs will be disrupted by AI in the coming months.For its part, Odyssey is pledging to collaborate with creative professionals — not replace them.“Interactive video … opens the door to entirely new forms of entertainment, where stories can be generated and explored on demand, free from the constraints and costs of traditional production,” writes the company in its blog post. “Over time, we believe everything that is video today — entertainment, ads, education, training, travel, and more — will evolve into interactive video, all powered by Odyssey.”Techcrunch eventSave now through June 4 for TechCrunch Sessions: AISave $300 on your ticket to TC Sessions: AI—and get 50% off a second.

The environments the model generates are blurry and distorted, and unstable in the sense that their layouts don’t always remain the same. Walk forward in one direction for a while or turn around, and the surroundings might suddenly look different.But the company’s promising to rapidly improve upon the model, which can currently stream video at up to 30 frames per second from clusters of Nvidia H100 GPUs at the cost of $1 to $2 per “user-hour.”The world played forward, by a model.On the one hand, it's calm and serene. On the other, it's chaotic and terrifying.I think the model nailed it in both cases.pic.twitter.com/vuszeL9p0V— Oliver Cameron (@olivercameron)May 28, 2025“Looking ahead, we’re researching richer world representations that capture dynamics far more faithfully, while increasing temporal stability and persistent state,” writes Odyssey in its post. “In parallel, we’re expanding the action space from motion to world interaction, learning open actions from large-scale video.”Odyssey is taking a different approach than many AI labs in the world modeling space. It designed a360-degree, backpack-mounted camera systemto capture real-world landscapes, which Odyssey thinks can serve as a basis for higher-quality models than models trained solely on publicly available data.To date, Odyssey has raised $27 million from investors, including EQT Ventures, GV, and Air Street Capital. Ed Catmull, one of the co-founders of Pixar and former president of Walt Disney Animation Studios, is on the startup’s board of directors.Last December, Odysseysaidit was working on software that allows creators to load scenes generated by its models into tools such as Unreal Engine, Blender, and Adobe After Effects so that they can be hand-edited.",

Soon, Spotify will also roll out new tools for podcast creators to recommend content and better engage with their fans in comments.The changes, while relatively minor, are a part of Spotify’s growing efforts to compete with Apple’s Podcasts app and YouTube. The latter has been investing more heavily in podcasts in recent years. This month, for instance, YouTube launched itsown weekly top podcast listto challenge Spotify and Apple. That chart highlights somemajor differences between the platformsin terms of what YouTube’s video viewers prefer to watch.Meanwhile, Spotify has also invested in video podcasts,allowing all creators to upload videoandincentivizing them with paymentsfor successful showsthrough its Partner Program.Despite these efforts, YouTube remains the service to beat in the U.S., at least, where one-third of weekly podcast listeners prefer the Google-owned service to Spotify or Apple.Spotify says the new podcast recommendations on the Home tab have already started to roll out to global users, and early feedback suggests it’s led to more users engaging with podcasts, saving, and liking shows.In addition, Spotify is introducing a Following feed that will serve as a dedicated spot where you can see all the latest episodes released by the podcasts you follow, instead of having to search across the app. (To access this feature, you’ll tap on the Podcasts button at the top of the app, then the Following button that appears to its right.)Techcrunch eventSave now through June 4 for TechCrunch Sessions: AISave $300 on your ticket to TC Sessions: AI—and get 50% off a second.

You can use AI-powered suggestions that combine multiple effects for quick edits with the new “AI Enhance” option. For example, you could combine AI effects like image sharpening and object removal.Or, you can tap specific parts of a photo to get suggested tools for editing that area. For example, Google may suggest that you adjust the lighting or blur the background.Google notes the redesign will start rolling out globally to Android devices next month, with iOS following later this year.The tech giant also announced that you can now share albums with QR codes to make it easier for others around you to access an album.

Late last year, AMDreportedlyteamed up with several Taiwan startups for a silicon photonics R&D collaboration.AMD says that its acquisition of Enosemi will “accelerate [its] co-packaged optics innovation for AI systems.”“As AI models grow larger and more complex, the need for faster, more efficient data movement is accelerating,” Brian Amick, SVP of tech and engineering at AMD, wrote in ablog post. “Enosemi has collaborated with us as an external development partner on photonics, and this acquisition extends that successful relationship. Now, as part of AMD, the team will help us immediately scale our ability to support and develop a variety of photonics and co-packaged optics solutions across next-gen AI systems.”Enosemi, based in Silicon Valley, builds and ships photonic integrated circuits — microchips containing two or more photonic components that form a functioning circuit.

This mission, designated Tianwen-2, followsthe Tianwen-1 mission, which became the first Chinese spacecraft to land on Mars in 2021.Chinese officials confirmed the 2.1-metric ton Tianwen-2 spacecraft unfurled its fan-shaped solar arrays shortly after launch, marking an auspicious start to a decade-long tour of the Solar System.China's objectives for Tianwen-2 are two-fold. First, Tianwen-2 will fly to a near-Earth asteroid designated 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, or 2016 HO3. Once there, the spacecraft will retrieve a rocky sample from the asteroid's surface and bring the material back to Earth in late 2027 for analysis in labs. After the spacecraft releases its sample carrier to land on Earth, Tianwen-2 will change course and head to a mysterious comet-like object found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.Tianwen-2 will become the first Chinese spacecraft to bring home celestial material from beyond the Moon, where China has landed two previous sample retrieval missions. China's exploits at the Moon have made its space program the world leader in 21st century lunar exploration, at least for now.Two in oneBut the Chinese space program lags behind the United States in exploring the Solar System. NASA and Japan's space agency have returned samples from asteroids before, while the European Space Agency has orbited a comet. Tianwen-2 will attempt to do both on a single mission.Scientists believe the asteroid selected for Tianwen-2 is less than 60 meters, or 200 feet, in diameter, and could be made of material thrown off the Moon some time in its ancient past. Results from Tianwen-2 may confirm that hypothesis.Artist's illustration of Tianwen-2 using one of its 11 scientific instruments to observe an asteroid.Credit:China National Space AdministrationAsteroid Kamoʻoalewa is a unique target for a sample return mission. The asteroid is a \"quasi-satellite\" of the Earth, meaning its orbit around the Sun closely matches that of our own planet. This keeps Kamoʻoalewa relatively close to Earth throughout the year, making it an attractive candidate for a sample return mission.That's one reason why Tianwen-2's roundtrip journey to asteroid Kamoʻoalewa will last just two-and-a-half years. Japan'sHayabusa 2 asteroid sample return missionlasted six years from launch through its return to Earth, while NASA'sOSIRIS-REx missionmade the trip to an asteroid back in seven years. Both visited near-Earth asteroids more distant than Kamoʻoalewa, where Tianwen-2 will arrive in July 2026 and start searching for a location to retrieve samples.Tianwen-2 will try to collect samples in several ways. One method will involve maneuvering the spacecraft close to the surface and matching the asteroid's rotation, and extending a robotic arm to gather specimens. The spacecraft will also descend to the asteroid's surface for a \"touch-and-go\" similar to the way Japan's Hayabusa 2 spacecraft and NASA's OSIRIS-REx sampled their asteroids.Scientists also hope to try another sampling method known as \"anchor-and-attach,\" where the spacecraft will secure itself to the asteroid's surface using four arms with drills at the ends of them. Chinese officials have not said how much material they hope to bring back to Earth, but Tianwen-2 is reportedly designed to collect at least 100 grams of rocks and dust from the asteroid.Mission planners know little about the shape of Kamoʻoalewa, but long-range measurements suggest it spins once every 28 minutes, relatively fast for an asteroid. This spin rate, coupled with the object's tenuous gravity, will complicate Tianwen-2's maneuvers near the asteroid.Once it has the samples in hand, Tianwen-2 will depart the asteroid in early 2027 and head for Earth, where it will release a reentry module containing bits of Kamoʻoalewa for landing in late 2027. Researchers will study the specimens to determine their basic physical properties, chemical, mineral, and isotopic compositions, textures, and structures, according to a paper published in the research journalEarth and Planetary Physics.In the paper, four Chinese scientists write that results from the sample return will not only improve knowledge of asteroids, but could tell us about the Earth and the Moon.\"Confirming the origin of Kamo’oalewa, from its prevailing provenance as debris of the Moon, could be a promising start to inferring the evolutionary history of the Moon,\" the scientists write in the journal. \"This history would probably include a more comprehensive view of the lunar far side and the origin of the asymmetry between the two sides of the Moon.\"Comet 311P/PanSTARRS was observed by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2013 with a set of six comet-like tails radiating from its main body. This object, also called P/2013 P5, is known as an active asteroid.Credit:NASA, ESA, and D. Jewitt (UCLA)Tianwen-2's mothership, with 11 scientific instruments, will commence the second phase of its mission after dropping off the asteroid specimens at Earth. The probe's next journey will bring it near an enigma in the asteroid belt named 311P/PanSTARRS in the mid-2030s. This object is one in a rare class of objects known as active asteroids or main-belt comets, small worlds that have tails and comas like comets but loiter in orbits most commonly associated with asteroids. Tianwen-2 will be the first mission to see such an object up close.Stepping into the Solar SystemUntil the last few years, China's space program has primarily centered on the Moon as a destination for scientific exploration. The Moon remains the main target for China's ambitions in space, with the goal of accomplishing a human lunar landing by 2030. But the country is looking farther afield, too.With the Tianwen-1 mission in 2021, China became the second country to achieve a soft landing on Mars. After Tianwen-2, China will again go to Mars with the Tianwen-3 sample return mission slated for launch in 2028.Tianwen, which means \"questions to heaven,\" is the name given to China's program of robotic Solar System exploration. Tianwen-3has a chance to become the first missionto return pristine samples from Mars to Earth. At the same time, NASA'splans for a Mars Sample Return missionare faltering.China is looking at launching Tianwen-4 around 2029 to travel to Jupiter and enter orbit around Callisto, one of its four largest moons. In the 2030s,China's roadmapincludes a mission to return atmospheric samples from Venus to Earth, a Mars research station, and a probe to Neptune.Meanwhile, NASA has sent spacecraft to study ever planet in the Solar System, and currently has spacecraft at or on the way to the Moon, Mars,Jupiter, ametal asteroid, and ininterstellar space. Another US science mission,Dragonfly, is scheduled for launch in 2028 on a daring expedition to Saturn's moon Titan.But NASA's science division isbracing for severe budget cutsproposed by President Donald Trump. In planetary science, the White House's budget blueprint calls for canceling a joint US-European Mars Sample Return mission and several other projects, including the DAVINCI mission to Venus.Stephen ClarkSpace ReporterStephen ClarkSpace ReporterStephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering private space companies and the world’s space agencies.

After gaining unauthorized administrative control of the devices, the threat actor installs a public encryption key for access to the device through SSH. From then on, anyone with the private key can automatically log in to the device with administrative system rights.Durable control“‍The attacker’s access survives both reboots and firmware updates, giving them durable control over affected devices,” researchers from security firm GreyNoisereported Wednesday. “The attacker maintains long-term access without dropping malware or leaving obvious traces by chaining authentication bypasses, exploiting a known vulnerability, and abusing legitimate configuration features.”GreyNoise said it has tracked roughly 9,000 devices around the world that have been backdoored in the ongoing campaign. That number continues to grow. Company researchers said they have no indication that the threat actor has deployed the infected devices in any activity. Rather, the hacks appear to be the beginning stages of the threat actor amassing a large number of compromised devices for future use.GreyNoise said it detected the campaign in mid-March and held off reporting on it until after the company notified unnamed government agencies. That detail further suggests that the threat actor may have some connection to a nation-state.The company researchers went on to say that the activity they observed was part of a larger campaignreported last weekby fellow security company Sekoia. Researchers at Sekoia said that Internet scanning by network intelligence firm Censys suggested as many as9,500 Asus routersmay have been compromised ViciousTrap, the name used to track the unknown threat actor.The attackers are backdooring the devices by exploiting multiple vulnerabilities. One is CVE-2023-39780, a command injection flaw that allows for the execution of system commands, which Asus patched in a recent firmware update, GreyNoise said. The remaining vulnerabilities have also been patched, but have not received CVE tracking designations for unknown reasons.The only way for router users to determine whether their devices are infected is by checking the SSH settings in the configuration panel. Infected routers will show that the device can be logged into by SSH over port 53282 using a digital certificate with a truncated key ofssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAo41nBoVFfj4HlVMGV+YPsxMDrMlbdDZ...To remove the backdoor, infected users should remove the key and the port setting.People can also determine if they’ve been targeted if system logs indicate that they have been accessed through the IP addresses 101.99.91[.]151, 101.99.94[.]173, 79.141.163[.]179, or 111.90.146[.]237.

Besides the high temperature, he seemed fine. So, after testing negative for COVID-19, doctors sent him home with supportive care. But the fever didn't go away.In the week that followed, things got worse. He developed nausea, stomach pain, and diarrhea. He also started having trouble breathing. He then went back to the hospital.This time, doctors found he needed supplemental oxygen. And an X-ray of his chest was worrisome—there were diffuse ground-glass opacities in his lungs. Doctors wondered if he had an unusual case of pneumonia. The man kept getting worse; in fact, he seemed to deteriorate before their eyes. Initially, he received supplemental oxygen through a simple face mask; subsequently, doctors switched to a mask that delivers continuous oxygen. However, his blood oxygen saturation continued to fall.He was admitted to the intensive care unit. There, he was quickly intubated and put on mechanical ventilation. Then, his cardiovascular system started to fail. He went into severe shock. His kidneys shut down, and doctors started dialysis. He was soon heavily sedated on fentanyl and other drugs while machines kept him alive. The case and the path to his diagnosis was published Wednesday inthe New England Journal of Medicine.Diagnostic challengeThe man's medical history offered few clues as to what could be going on. He was generally healthy and worked in an office without any risky occupational exposures. He had a history of gallstones and a recent root canal—nothing obviously concerning. He had been camping recently in a rural area of Chascomús, south of Buenos Aires. But he reported no insect bites, contact with rodents, or other exposures.Lab results showed that his blood had abnormally high concentrations of red and white blood cells, and low levels of platelets. He tested negative for a slew of infections, including COVID-19 (again), influenza, HIV, dengue, and the bacterial blood infection leptospirosis. Computed tomography (CT) scans of his lungs showed more ground-glass opacities as well as a \"halo sign,\" a blotch on scans that sometimes signals invasive fungal infections. There were also signs of lung collapse and fluid buildup (edema).It was a diagnostic challenge, and doctors began reviewing the list of possibilities that could match his condition. The first guess of pneumonia could explain some of his respiratory findings, but he didn't have a cough, had tested negative for common respiratory pathogens, and the lung imaging didn't quite fit, making it seem unlikely. Blood cancers, such as polycythemia vera, might be able to explain the high concentrations of blood cells. And it might also make him more vulnerable to opportunistic lung infections, like a fungal infection that could explain the halo sign. But blood cancers were also deemed unlikely given that he didn't have enlarged organs, which is often seen with such conditions. Another possibility of pulmonary–renal syndrome, but that also didn't line up with the man's case.DiagnosisThere was one other possibility that seemed to tick all the boxes: fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, low oxygen saturation, pulmonary edema, and shock—a hantavirus infection.Hantaviruses are RNA viruses that infect rodents worldwide. They typically cause asymptomatic, chronic infections in the animals, which spread the virus widely into their environments through their urine, feces, and saliva. Humans get infected when virus particles from rodent-contaminated areas are stirred up into the air and inhaled, or through direct contact with the virus via the eyes, nose, mouth, or cuts.In humans, the viral infection is anything but asymptomatic. Whilethe disease mechanismisn't entirely understood, the virus appears to be able to modulate immune responses in humans, causing blood vessels and capillaries in various places in the body to start leaking plasma. This leads to fluid building up in the lungs (the pulmonary edema) and systemic circulatory collapse.A cardiopulmonary hantavirus infection typically has four stages: the incubation period, which can last up to 45 days after virus exposure; a prodromal phase up to 12 days that are marked by fever, fatigue, and pains; the cardiopulmonary phase, where breathing trouble, low oxygen saturation, and shock can develop; then, if you make it, the fourth stage, in which respiratory symptoms improve, but there's lingering fatigue and the kidneys make abnormally large amounts of urine.Haunting risksThere is no specific treatment for hantavirus; medical care is mostly supportive. The man ended up staying in the ICU for 40 days, gradually improving with all of the interventions. When his condition stabilized, he was moved to a specialized rehabilitation center for respiratory and neuromuscular recovery. He went on to make a full recovery and visited the ICU where he had been treated.Doctors suspect that he was infected with hantavirus on his camping trip Chascomús, where the virus is endemic, despite not recalling any rodent exposure. His medical follow-up included discussions of infection-control measures at the rural property, in case he ever decides to go camping there again.Hantaviruses are found throughout the world, including in the US. North and South America are home to \"New World Hantaviruses,\" which cause cardiopulmonary syndrome, while countries in Europe and Asia have \"Old World Hantaviruses,\" which cause hemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome.In the US, between 20 and 40 cases are logged annually, with most cases identified west of the Mississippi River. Sincefederal surveillancebegan in 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has documented over 800 cases. About 35 percent of US cases have been fatal.The infection has been in the US news recently with thedeaths of pianist Betsy Arakawa and actor Gene Hackman. The married couple was found dead in their home in New Mexico, a state with one of the highest national tallies of hantavirus infections. After an investigation, Arakawa's cause of death was identified a pulmonary hantavirus and a rodent infestation was found on the property. Hackman's cause of death was heart disease, with advanced Alzheimer's as a contributing factor.Beth MoleSenior Health ReporterBeth MoleSenior Health ReporterBeth is Ars Technica’s Senior Health Reporter.

The partnership dates back to 2022, part of a wide-ranging agreement that also saw Stellantis pick Amazon Web Services as its cloud platform for new vehicles and Amazon sign on as the first customer for Ram's fully electric ProMaster EV van.A key aspect of the Amazon-Stellantis partnership was to be a software platform for new Stellantis vehicles called STLA SmartCockpit. Meant to debut last year, SmartCockpit was supposed to \"seamlessly integrate with customers’ digital lives to create personalized, intuitive in-vehicle experiences,\" using Alexa and other AI agents to provide better in-car entertainment but also navigation, vehicle maintenance, and in-car payments as well.But 2024 came and went without the launch of SmartCockpit, and now the joint work has wound down,according to Reuters, although not for any particular reason the news organization could discern. Rather, the companies said in a statement that they \"will allow each team to focus on solutions that provide value to our shared customers and better align with our evolving strategies.\"Stellantis continues to work with Amazon in other areas—Stellantis isn't migrating away from AWS anytime soon that we know, and Amazon provides the Fire TVs that are an option on Chrysler's Pacifica minivan. More broadly, Amazon has been placing Alexa inside the infotainment systems of dozens of OEMs as it competes with other tech giants to claim a slice of vehicles' digital footprint.Amazon Fire TVs are still an option for the back seat of the Pacifica.Credit: StellantisBut Amazon is still a minor player compared to its rivals. Google's Android Automotive OS is now built into hundreds of new models, including all Stellantis vehicles that ship with uConnect 5. And many more use more modified Android-based OSes.

    "content": "Text settingsStory textSizeSmallStandardLargeWidth*StandardWideLinksStandardOrange* Subscribers onlyLearn moreMinimize to navIn some ways, Getty Images has emerged as one of the most steadfast defenders of artists' rights in AI copyright fights. Starting in 2022, when some of the most sophisticated image generators todayfirst started testing new models offering better compositions, Gettybanned AI-generated uploads to its service. And by the next year, Getty released a\"socially responsible\" image generatorto prove it was possible to build a tool while rewarding artists, while suing an AI firm that refused to pay artists.But in the years since, Getty Images CEO Craig Peters recentlytold CNBCthat the media company has discovered that it's simply way too expensive to fight every AI copyright battle.According to Peters, Getty has dumped millions into just one copyright fight against Stability AI.It's \"extraordinarily expensive,\" Peters told CNBC. \"Even for a company like Getty Images, we can’t pursue all the infringements that happen in one week.\" He confirmed that “we can’t pursue it because the courts are just prohibitively expensive. We are spending millions and millions of dollars in one court case.\"Fair use?Getty sued Stability AI in 2023, after the AI company's image generator, Stable Diffusion, started spitting out images that replicated Getty's famous trademark. In the complaint, Getty alleged that Stability AI had trained Stable Diffusion on \"more than 12 million photographs from Getty Images’ collection, along with the associated captions and metadata, without permission from or compensation to Getty Images, as part of its efforts to build a competing business.\"As Getty saw it, Stability AI had plenty of opportunity to license the images from Getty and seemingly \"chose to ignore viable licensing options and long-standing legal protections in pursuit of their stand-alone commercial interests.\"Stability AI, like all AI firms, has argued that AI training based on freely scraping images from the web is a \"fair use\" protected under copyright law.So far, courts have not settled this debate, while many AI companies have urged judges and governments globally to settle it for the courts, for the sake of safeguarding national security and securing economic prosperity by winning the AI race. According to AI companies, paying artists to train on their works threatens to slow innovation, while rivals in China—who aren't bound by US copyright law—continue scraping the web to advance their models.Peters called out Stability AI for adopting this stance, arguing that rightsholders shouldn't have to spend millions fighting against a claim that paying out licensing fees would \"kill innovation.\" Some critics have likened AI firms' argument to a defense of forced labor, suggesting the US would never value \"innovation\" about human rights, and the same logic should follow for artists' rights.\"We’re battling a world of rhetoric,\" Peters said, alleging that these firms \"are taking copyrighted material to develop their powerful AI models under the guise of innovation and then 'just turning those services right back on existing commercial markets.'\"To Peters, that’s simply \"disruption under the notion of ‘move fast and break things,’\" and Getty believes \"that’s unfair competition.\"\"We’re not against competition,\" Peters said. \"There’s constant new competition coming in all the time from new technologies or just new companies. But that [AI scraping] is just unfair competition, that’s theft.\"Broader Internet backlash over AI firms’ rhetoricPeters' comments come after a former Meta head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, received Internet backlash this week after making the same claim that AI firms raise time and again: that asking artists for consent for AI training would \"kill\" the AI industry, The Vergereported.According to Clegg, the only viable solution to the tension between artists and AI companies would be to give artists ways to opt out of training, whichStability AI notably started doingin 2022.\"Quite a lot of voices say, 'You can only train on my content, [if you] first ask,'\" Clegg reportedly said. \"And I have to say that strikes me as somewhat implausible because these systems train on vast amounts of data.\"On X, the CEO of Fairly Trained—a nonprofit that supports artists' fight against nonconsensual AI training—Ed Newton-Rex (who is also a former Stability AI vice president of audio) pushed back on Clegg's claim in apostviewed by thousands.\"Nick Clegg is wrong to say artists’ demands on AI & copyright are unworkable,\" Newton-Rex said. \"Every argument he makes could equally have been made about Napster:\" First, that \"the tech is out there,\" second that \"licensing takes time,\" and third that, \"we can’t control what other countries do.\" If Napster's operations weren't legal, neither should AI firms' training, Newton-Rex said, writing, \"These are not reasons not to uphold the law and treat creators fairly.\"Other social media users mocked Clegg with jokes meant to destroy AI firms' favorite go-to argument against copyright claims.\"Blackbeard says asking sailors for permission to board and loot their ships would 'kill' the piracy on the high seas industry,\" an X user with the handle \"Seanchuckle\"wrote.On Bluesky, a trial lawyer, Max Kennerly, effectively satirized Clegg and the whole AI industry bywriting,\"Our product creates such little value that it is simply not viable in the marketplace, not even as a niche product. Therefore, we must be allowed to unilaterally extract value from the work of others and convert that value into our profits.\"Other ways to fightGetty plans to continue fighting against the AI firms that are impressing this \"world of rhetoric\" on judges and lawmakers, but court battles will likely remain few and far between due to the price tag, Peters has suggested.There are other ways to fight, though. In asubmissionlast month, Getty pushed the Trump administration to reject \"those seeking to weaken US copyright protections by creating a 'right to learn' exemption\" for AI firms when building Trump's AI Action Plan.\"US copyright laws are not obstructing the path to continued AI progress,\" Getty wrote. \"Instead, US copyright laws are a path to sustainable AI and a path that broadens society’s participation in AI’s economic benefits, which reduces downstream economic burdens on the Federal, State and local governments. US copyright laws provide incentives to invest and create.\"In Getty's submission, the media company emphasized that requiring consent for AI training is not an \"overly restrictive\" control on AI's development such as those sought by stauncher critics \"that could harm US competitiveness, national security or societal advances such as curing cancer.\" And Getty claimed it also wasn't \"requesting protection from existing and new sources of competition,\" despite the lawsuit's suggestion that Stability AI and other image generators threaten to replace Getty's image library in the market.What Getty said it hopes Trump's AI plan will ensure is a world where the rights and opportunities of rightsholders are not \"usurped for the commercial benefits\" of AI companies.In 2023, when Getty was first suing Stability AI, Peters suggested that, otherwise, allowing AI firms to widely avoid paying artists would create \"a sad world,\" perhaps disincentivizing creativity.Ashley BelangerSenior Policy ReporterAshley BelangerSenior Policy ReporterAshley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated to tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.

The court asked the US solicitor general to file a brief expressing the views of the United States government. Solicitor General John Sauer, a Trump nominee, filed abriefyesterday.The Supreme Court \"should grant certiorari to address the first question presented in Cox's petition: whether an ISP materially contributes to copyright infringement by continuing to provide Internet access to particular subscribers after receiving notice that copyright infringement has occurred on their accounts,\" Sauer wrote.Last year, the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuitvacated a $1 billion damages awardthat Cox would have had to pay because it found that Cox did not receive a direct financial benefit from its subscribers' infringement of copyrights. But the appeals court affirmed a jury's finding that Cox was guilty of willful contributory infringement, raising the likelihood that ISPs would have to terminate customers accused of piracy to avoid liability. The case was filed by Sony and other record labels.Widespread terminations fearedThe 4th Circuit decision, if not overturned, \"subjects ISPs to potential liability for all acts of copyright infringement committed by particular subscribers as long as the music industry sends notices alleging past instances of infringement by those subscribers,\" Sauer wrote. This could \"encourage providers to avoid substantial monetary liability by terminating subscribers after receiving a single notice of alleged infringement.\"Sauer wrote that the \"court of appeals' decision holding Cox liable departs from this Court's contributory-infringement precedents... The contributory-infringement question is legally and practically important, and courts of appeals have taken divergent approaches to the question.\"The US brief argued that \"an ISP is not liable for contributory copyright infringement for failing to terminate subscribers after receiving notices of infringement.\" Rulings inSony v. Universal City StudiosandMGM Studios v. Grokster\"make clear that contributory liability for copyright infringement requires more than knowledge that others have put the defendant's products to infringing uses,\" Sauer wrote. \"Instead, it requires 'culpable intent' to cause infringement.\"\"If Cox had explicitly or implicitly marketed its service as being particularly useful for infringers, or if it had encouraged subscribers to use Cox's Internet service to infringe, liability might be appropriate,\" Sauer wrote. \"But as the court of appeals acknowledged, Cox's business model was indifferent to whether its subscribers used the Internet for lawful or unlawful purposes.\"Piracy notices don’t identify specific usersAdopting Sony's legal theory would \"threaten liability for other service providers (e.g., an electric utility) that might be asked to cut off service to identified customers who had previously used the service for unlawful purposes,\" Sauer wrote. Sauer also noted that infringement notices sent by copyright holders don't identify individual users:Sony overstates the specificity of Cox's knowledge. Even accepting \"that notices of past infringement\" establish Cox's \"knowledge that the same subscriber was substantially certain to infringe again,\" the notices made Cox aware of past and likely future infringement on particular accounts; they did not identify the specific infringing users of Cox's Internet services. Many accounts that triggered multiple notices belonged to hotels, hospitals, universities, and regional ISPs serving hundreds or thousands of individual users. Under the decision below, Cox would be held liable for direct infringement committed by any of those users, whose identities it does not know and with whom it has no contractual relationship.Sauer further argued that the Supreme Court should \"grant review of the second question presented in Cox's petition, which concerns the circumstances under which a contributory infringer can be held liable for enhanced statutory damages based on a finding of 'willful' infringement.\"Enhanced damages can be $150,000 per work, instead of the usual cap of $30,000. The jury in the case \"was instructed that it could find Cox's violations willful if Cox knew thatits subscribershad committed infringement,\" Sauer wrote. \"That instruction was mistaken because it allowed the jury to award enhanced damages even if Cox reasonably believed thatits ownconduct in declining to terminate infringing subscribers' Internet access was consistent with the Copyright Act.\"Reject Sony petition, US saysSony wasn't happy with the 4th Circuit ruling, either, because it threw out the $1 billion award and a finding of vicarious infringement. Sonyarguedthat Cox profited from infringement by failing to terminate infringing subscribers and that the ruling \"eliminates an especially important tool in the digital age where pursuing direct infringers—in this case, thousands of faceless individuals who cannot be identified except through an Internet service provider like Respondent—is impractical at best and impossible at worst.\"Sauer urged the Supreme Court to reject Sony's petition for a review. \"The court of appeals correctly held that Sony had not satisfied its burden of showing that Cox financially benefited from infringement on its network. As the court explained, Cox charges its customers a flat fee for Internet service, regardless of what its users do online,\" Sauer wrote.Sauer compared Cox to a landlord who charges a fixed rent regardless of what tenants use the leased premises for. \"There was no evidence that Cox would be forced to collect a lower fee if the users of its Internet service ceased to infringe; that subscribers were drawn to Cox's Internet service because of the ability to engage in copyright infringement using that service; or that Cox had used the opportunity for customers to infringe to lend credibility to the service it offered,\" Sauer wrote.On the vicarious liability question, \"there is no conflict among the circuits, which all apply the same financial-benefit requirement to different fact patterns,\" Sauer wrote. \"Sony has not identified any court of appeals decision that reached a different result on facts similar to those here.\"Cox issued a statement welcoming the US court brief. \"We are pleased the solicitor general agrees the Supreme Court should review this significant copyright case that could jeopardize Internet access for all Americans and fundamentally change how Internet service providers manage their networks,\" Cox said.Jon BrodkinSenior IT ReporterJon BrodkinSenior IT ReporterJon is a Senior IT Reporter for Ars Technica.

However, Samsung is making unusually good time this cycle. Owners of the company'sGalaxy S25 phonescan get an early look at One UI 8 (based on Android 16) in the new open beta program. Samsung promises a lot of upgrades, but it may not feel that way.Signing up for the beta is a snap—just open the Samsung Members app, and the beta signup should be right on the main landing page. From there, the OTA update should appear on your device within a few minutes. It's pretty hefty at 3.4GB, but the installation is quick, and none of your data should be affected. That said, backups are always advisable when using beta software.You must be in the US, Germany, Korea, or the UK to join the beta, and US phones must be unlocked or the T-Mobile variants. The software is compatible with the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra—the newS25 Edgeneed not apply (for now).Samsung'sbig pitchhere might not resonate with everyone: more AI. It's a bit vague about what exactly that means, though. The company claims One UI 8 brings \"multimodal capabilities, UX tailored to different device form factors, and personalized, proactive suggestions.\" Having used the new OS for a few hours, it doesn't seem like much has changed with Samsung's AI implementation.The One UI 8 beta is large, but installation doesn't take very long.Credit: Ryan WhitwamThe One UI 8 beta is large, but installation doesn't take very long.Credit: Ryan WhitwamThe Galaxy S25 series launched with a feature called Now Brief, along with a companion widget called Now Bar. The idea is that this interface will assimilate your data, process it privately inside the Samsung Knox enclave, and spit out useful suggestions. For the most part, it doesn't. While Samsung says One UI 8 will allow Now Brief to deliver more personal, customized insights, it seems to do the same handful of things it did before. It's plugged into a lot of Samsung apps and data sources, but mostly just shows weather information, calendar events, and news articles you probably won't care about. There were some hints of an upcoming audio version of Now Brief, but that's not included in the beta.Samsung does promise some non-AI changes, though. One UI 8 has an enhanced version of Auracast, a Bluetooth LE technology that helps with device pairing. After the update, you'll be able to pair quickly with QR code scanning, allowing multiple Bluetooth devices, like earbuds and hearing aids, to stream audio from your phone. Quick Share is quicker to activate from the Quick Settings, too, which seems appropriate.Samsung's revamped Quick Share UI and the new Reminders app in One UI 8.Credit: SamsungSamsung's revamped Quick Share UI and the new Reminders app in One UI 8.Credit: SamsungThere's also a new Reminder app baked into the OS, which Samsung describes as \"easy-looking even for first-time users.\" The app does seem capable and straightforward, but it's hardly something that should be getting top billing in an OS update.While it's possible there will be more to the final One UI 8 update, Samsung's decision to roll out the beta widely probably means this is very close to finished. Given the disappointing state of Galaxy AI at the S25's launch, it's troubling there's not more to care about in the Android 16 update so far.According to Samsung, this update marks the beginning of a \"new rhythm\" for its software evolution. That suggests it will stick to Google's new goal of releasing two sizable Android updates per year, with the first release making major changes and the second refining APIs and features. Samsung also mentioned that One UI 8 will come pre-loaded on its next-generation Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 this summer.Ryan WhitwamSenior Technology ReporterRyan WhitwamSenior Technology ReporterRyan Whitwam is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering the ways Google, AI, and mobile technology continue to change the world.

In February,Vargas issueda preliminary injunction prohibiting the Treasury Department from granting DOGE access to systems containing personally identifiable information or confidential financial information.In April, VargasallowedDOGE employee Ryan Wunderly to access the Treasury Department's Bureau of Fiscal Services (BFS) system, after government declarations said \"that Wunderly has undergone the same vetting and security clearance process that applies to any other Treasury Department employee provided with access to BFS payment systems.\" In anorder yesterday, Vargas ruled that four more employees can access the system.\"The issue before the Court is a narrow one. The parties are in agreement that, in light of this Court's PI [Preliminary Injunction] Modification Order, the New DOGE Employees should be permitted to have access to BFS payment systems on the same terms as Wunderly,\" Vargas wrote. \"Treasury DOGE Team\" employees Thomas Krause, Linda Whitridge, Samuel Corcos, and Todd Newnam have satisfied the conditions for accessing the system, she wrote.Court won’t vet new hiresAdditionally, the Trump administration can add more DOGE team members without the court's prior approval. Saying that \"there is little utility in having this Court function as Treasury's de facto human resources officer each time a new team member is onboarded,\" Varagas said the injunction's restrictions won't apply to staff who have met the requirements.The staff must undergo the required training and be \"subject to the same vetting requirements as applied to other Treasury employees provided access to such data systems.\" They must also be \"employees of the Treasury Department hired in accordance with governing statutes and regulations\" and be supervised and directly report to Treasury Department officials, the order said.The preliminary injunction will stay in effect subject to those modifications. \"Should the preliminary injunction remain in place unaltered, the Government would be required to obtain judicial approval each time there is turnover in the ranks of the DOGE Team,\" Vargas wrote. \"Should it be vacated in its entirety, Plaintiffs fear a resumption of the arbitrary and capricious conduct that the Court found likely violated the APA [Administrative Procedure Act]. Neither outcome is optimal.\"Vargas' order in February said the states suing Trump are likely to \"prevail on their claim that the challenged agency action was arbitrary and capricious.\" She found that career staff \"did their best to develop what mitigation strategies they could\" in response to demands that DOGE be given access but that \"the inexplicable urgency and time constraints under which they operated all but ensured that the launch of the Treasury DOGE Team was chaotic and haphazard.\"A rocky startDOGE staffer Marko Elez, whoresignedafter being linked to a social media account that posted racist messages, was given full access without any real training, Vargas wrote in February. This happened shortly after a longtime Treasury Department officialresignedafter clashing with DOGE over its requests for access.As Vargas wrote in February:The Treasury DOGE Team started its work almost immediately [after Trump's executive order], even though it did not yet have either the HR specialist or the attorney that the E.O. mandated should be members of the team. This left career staff with almost no time to develop their mitigation measures. Within days of his appointment, and apparently after receiving minimal, if any, training regarding the handling of sensitive government information (beyond being instructed to maintain the information on his BFS laptop), Elez was given full access to system source codes. Perhaps most troubling is that Elez was mistakenly given read/write access to SPS [Secure Payment System]. Although this error was discovered the day Elez resigned, it speaks to the hurried nature of this process that it occurred at all.While states appear likely to succeed on the \"arbitrary and capricious\" claim, Vargas said most of the states' claims are likely to fail. For example, \"claims based upon the Privacy Act are unlikely to succeed on the merits\" because \"the States' interest in the protection of its own financial data is not the type of interest the Privacy Act was enacted to protect,\" Vargas wrote.Privacy claims could succeed in other cases against the government. In one case filed by unions, a federal judge in Marylanddeterminedthat the Department of Education and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) likely violated the Privacy Act by disclosing personal information to DOGE affiliates without people's consent. Another casefiled by unionsagainst OPM is pending in New York, with a hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction scheduled for tomorrow.Jon BrodkinSenior IT ReporterJon BrodkinSenior IT ReporterJon is a Senior IT Reporter for Ars Technica.

    "content": "Text settingsStory textSizeSmallStandardLargeWidth*StandardWideLinksStandardOrange* Subscribers onlyLearn moreMinimize to navThe current incarnation of Google Photos was not Google's first image management platform, but it's been a big success. Ten years on, Google Photos remains one of Google's most popular products, and it's getting a couple of new features to celebrate its 10th year in operation. You'll be able to share albums a bit more easily, and editing tools are getting a boost with, you guessed it, AI.Google Photos made a splash in 2015 when itbroke freeof the spiraling Google+ social network, offering people supposedly unlimited free storage for compressed images. Of course, that was too good to last. In 2021, Googlebegan limiting photo uploadsto 15GB for free users, sharing the default account level storage with other services like Gmail and Drive. Today, Google encourages everyone to pay for a Google One subscription to get more space, which is a bit of a bummer. Regardless, people still use Google Photos extensively.According to the company, Photos has more than 1.5 billion monthly users, and it stores more than 9 trillion photos and videos. When using the Photos app on a phone, you are prompted to automatically upload your camera roll, which makes it easy to keep all your memories backed up (and edge ever closer to the free storage limit). Photos has also long offered almost magical search capabilities, allowing you to search for the content of images to find them. That may seem less impressive now, but it was revolutionary a decade ago. Google says users perform over 370 million searches in Photos each month.An AI anniversaryGoogle islocked in with AIas it reimagines most of its products and services with Gemini. As it refreshes Photos for its 10th anniversary, the editor is getting a fresh dose of AI. And this may end up one of Google's most used AI features—more than 210 million images are edited in Photos every month.Google says the new Photos editor uses AI to make \"helpful suggestions\" for your pics, and it has been redesigned to put all the editing tools in one place. AI in the app can suggest multiple edits in one go to change—and hopefully improve—your images. You can also tap or circle specific parts of an image to get tool suggestions for that area.That's not all. The new editor will add Reimagine and Auto Frame, which were originally exclusive to the Pixel 9 series. Reimagine allows you to select a part of the image and then enter a prompt to change it, remove an object, or add something new with generative AI. Auto Frame does what it sounds like—it adjusts the framing of a photo and uses generative AI to fill in the gaps around your subject.There's one last addition to Photos as it ages into double digits. Thus far, album sharing has been limited to URL links and contacts, a feature that is used over 440 million times per month. In the new update, Google is adding the option to use QR codes. You can display the code on your screen or print it out to give people the ability to view and, if you choose, add images to an album. That could be a fun way to collect and share images from an event or party.Google says the revamped editing update will come to Android devices in June. Sadly, iPhone users will have to wait until \"later this year\" for the new editing tools.Ryan WhitwamSenior Technology ReporterRyan WhitwamSenior Technology ReporterRyan Whitwam is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering the ways Google, AI, and mobile technology continue to change the world.

    "content": "Text settingsStory textSizeSmallStandardLargeWidth*StandardWideLinksStandardOrange* Subscribers onlyLearn moreMinimize to navLate on Friday, Amazon announced that it wascancelingits TV adaptation of Robert Jordan’sWheel of Timeseries, after several uncomfortable weeks of silence that followedthe show’s third season finale.Fans of the series can take some cold comfort in the fact that itapparently wasn’t an easy decision to make. But as we speculated in our write-up of what ended up being the show’s series finale, an expensive show with a huge cast, tons of complicated costuming and effects, and extensive location shooting only makes mathematical sense if it’s a megahit, andThe Wheel of Timewas never a megahit.Adapting the unadaptableI was sad about the cancellation announcement because I believe this season was the one where the show found its footing, both as an adaptation of a complex book series and as a fun TV show in its own right. But I wasn'tsurprisedby it. The only thing I found surprising was that it took this long to happen.Two things conspired to make it impossible for thisWheel of Timeshow to ever reach the Last Battle. One has to do with the source material itself; the other has to do with the way the TV business has changed sinceGame of Thronespremiered in 2011.The Wheel of Timeactively resists adaptation. It's a sprawling 14-book series spanning dozens of named point-of-view characters and impossibly dense politics. And it even spans multiple eras stylistically—the early books were more Tolkien-esque in their focus on small bands of adventurers and a limited number of perspectives, where later books could go for multiple chapters without putting you in the head of one of the series' half-dozen-ish main protagonists. And even among the series' die-hard fans, most will admit that there are storylines, characters, or entire books that feel inessential or annoying or repetitive or sloggy or wheel-spinning.Any adaptation would need to find a way to stay true to the story that the books were telling and to marry the tone and pacing of the early, middle, and late-series books while wrestling with the realities of a different medium (in particular, you cannot realistically pay for infinite episodes or pay infinite cast members, especially for a live-action show).By season 3, the show had become adept at translating big book moments for the screen.That high degree of difficulty was surely one reason why it took someone so long to decide to tackleThe Wheel of Time, even in the post-Peter Jackson, post-Harry Potter, post-Marvel Cinematic Universe, post-Game of Thronescreative landscape where nerd-coded sci-fi and fantasy were suddenly cool, where multi-part book adaptations were drawing dollars and eyeballs, and where convoluted interconnected stories could be billion-dollar businesses. The only stab anyone took at an adaptation before Amazon happened a full decade ago, when a fly-by-night production companyaired a hastily shot adaptation of the first book's prologuein an apparent attempt to keep the TV rights from expiring.It's also what makes the cancellation news so much more frustrating—over three seasons, showrunner Rafe Judkins and the cast and crew of the show became adept at adapting the unadaptable. Yes, the story and the characters had changed in a lot of major ways. Yes, the short eight-episode seasons made for frenetic pacing and overstuffed episodes. But if you grit your teeth a bit and push through the show's mess of a first season, you hit a series that seemed to know what must-hit scenes needed to be shown; which parts of the books were skippable or could be combined with other moments; which parts of later books to pull forward to streamline the story without making those moments feel rushed or unearned. It was imperfect, but it was a true adaptation—a reworking of a story for a much different medium that seemed to know how to keep the essence of the story intact.Ambition meets realityLike Rand al'Thor struggling with the One Power,The Wheel of Timestruggled against the realities of the current TV landscape.Credit: Prime/Amazon MGM StudiosThe thing that doomed this particularWheel of Timeproduction from the start was the sky-high expectations that Amazon had for it. BothWheel of Timeand the heartbreakingly blandRings of Powerwere born of Jeff Bezos'desire to find his ownGame of Thrones, which became an unexpected smash-hit success that dominated the cultural conversation through the 2010s. Most TV shows either launch strongly before slowly fading, or they build an audience over a few seasons andthenfade after reaching their peak.Game of Thronesdefied these trends, and each new seasondrew a larger and larger viewership even as the show's quality (arguably) dipped over time.AskingWheel of Timeto replicate that success would be a tall order for any television show in any era—pop culture is littered with shows that have tried and failed to clone another network's successful formula. But it's an especially difficult hurdle to clear in the fractured 2020s TV landscape.Streaming TV's blank-check era—which ran roughly from Netflix's introduction of itsfirst original shows in 2013to 2022, when Netflix reported itsfirst big dip in subscribersjust asa long era of low-interest lending was coming to an end—used to give shows a ton of runway and plenty of seasons to tell their stories. Shows likeOrange Is the New BlackorBoJack Horsemanthat found some modicum of critical acclaim and ratings success tended to get renewed multiple times, and six or seven-season runs were common.A commitment to reviving old, critically beloved bubble shows likeArrested Development,Community,Futurama, andGilmore Girlsalso sent a message: Freed from the restrictive economics of the Old TV Model and fueled by the promise of infinite growth, we can make whatever TV we want!Those days are mostly gone now (except perhaps at Apple TV+, which continues to leverage its parent company's deep pockets to throw gobs of money at any actor or IP with a moderately recognizable name). In the two years since TV streamers began cutting back in earnest, industry analysts have observeda consistent trendtoward shorter seasons of fewer episodes and fewer renewals for existing shows.Those trends hit at the exact wrong moment forThe Wheel of Time, which was constantly straining against the bonds of its eight-episode seasons. It's impossible to say empirically whether longer seasons would have made for a better show, and whether that \"better show\" could have achieved the kind of word-of-mouth success it would have needed to meet Amazon's expectations. But speaking anecdotally as someone who was just beginning to recommend the show to people who weren't hardcore book readers, the density and pacing were two major barriers to entry. And even the most truncated possible version of the story would have needed at least six or seven seasons to wrap up in anything resembling a satisfactory way, based on the pace that was set in the first three seasons.The end ofTimeWheel of Timefans didn't get to see everything translated from book to screen. But we did get to see a lot of things.Credit: Prime/Amazon MGM StudiosTellingly, theWheel of Time's creative team hasn't released faux-optimistic boilerplate statements about trying to shop the show to other networks, the kind of statements you sometimes see after a show is canceled before its creators are done with it. The same economics that made Amazon drop the show also make it nearly impossible to sell to anyone else.And soThe Wheel of Timejoins TV's long list of unfinished stories. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But this isanending.Andrew CunninghamSenior Technology ReporterAndrew CunninghamSenior Technology ReporterAndrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

As alleged by the FTC,Meta's internal emails laid barethat Meta's motive in acquiring both Instagram and WhatsApp was to pay whatever it took to snuff out dominant rivals threatening to lure users away from Facebook—Mark Zuckerberg's jewel.Talkingto Bloomberg, Meta has maintained that the FTC's case is weak, seeking to undo deals that the FTC approved long ago while ignoring the competition Meta faces from rivals in the broader social media market, like TikTok. But Meta's attempt to shut down the case mid-trial was rebuffed by Boasberg, who has signaled he will take months to weigh his decision.In a statement, Meta's spokesperson told Ars that Meta spent six weeks defending its deals while the FTC showed \"that no deal is ever truly final.\" Meta appears \"confident\" that the case will end in a win, Sruthi Thatchenkery, an assistant professor of strategy at Vanderbilt University’s Owen Graduate School of Management, told Bloomberg, noting that it's \"very hard to unwind a merger.\"\"The only thing the FTC showed was the dynamic, hyper-competitive nature of the past, present, and future of the technology industry,\" Meta's spokesperson said.Boasberg is not expected to hold closing arguments, The New York Timesreported. Instead, Meta and the FTC will file follow-up briefings over the summer, after which Boasberg has said he will work \"expeditiously\" to arrive at a ruling on whether Meta's purchases violated antitrust law. His ruling could come before the end of the year, Bloomberg reported.It's unclear which way Boasberg is leaning or if he would even require a breakup in the event of an FTC win. Bloomberg noted that the judge \"will have some latitude to come up with his own solution,\" perhaps finding \"that only one of the deals was illegal\" and requiring \"only a sale of that service.\" The FTC has also recommendedrequiring Meta to make its platforms interoperable with other platforms, which experts told Ars would spur competition by giving users an easy way to port their entire social network to a rival app if Meta's apps become too degraded.Experts note that there's also a chance the FTC and Meta reach a settlement before the verdict comes, although the FTC supposedly previously rejected Meta's $1 billion settlement bid, The Wall Street Journalreported.The FTC has said a breakup spinning off both apps is necessary, with a senior official last week telling press that the Meta case seemingly hits at the very heart of antitrust law, the NYT reported.\"This case presents a very important legal principle, which is that a firm that is a monopolist cannot acquire its most threatening competitors,\" the FTC official said. \"Antitrust law requires competition on the merits, even in digital markets, and it’s competition on the merits that drives innovation and ultimately helps consumers.\"Although the FTC has not commented on the trial ending, a spokesperson previously alleged that Meta's entire defense came from \"primarily its own self-interested executives and paid experts.\"Whichever side wins, the other side is expected to quickly appeal, and if the FTC wins, the trial will continue as Boasberg evaluates potential remedies. Meta—which the NYT described as putting its future in Boasberg's hands—will likely defend its deals to the end, as \"Instagram is now Meta's biggest money maker in the US,\" accounting for more than 50 percent of its ad revenue in 2025, The Guardianreported.\"Meta is a proud American success story, and we look forward to continuing to innovate and serve the people and businesses who love our services,\" Meta's spokesperson said.Experts aren’t so sure Meta has clinched itBoasberg has said that the key question he must answer is whether the FTC's market definition is too narrow.Arguing against the market definition, Meta has said thatconnecting friends and family isn't even Meta apps' \"core use\" anymore, as an evolving competitive social media landscape has forced Meta to turn its newsfeeds into discovery engines to rival TikTok. Justin Teresi, an antitrust analyst, told Bloomberg that because the FTC failed to show that users primarily come to Meta apps to connect with friends and family, it may have strengthened Meta's case.Rebecca Allensworth, a Vanderbilt law professor and antitrust expert, told Bloomberg that the \"FTC’s narrowly defined market was always the weakest part of its case,\" but the government \"has done a nice job of minimizing that weakness\" by showing that apps that don't connect friends and family aren't adequate substitutes for Meta's apps.\"This was evident when Meta saw spikes in usage on holidays,\" Allensworth suggested, which is perhaps \"a sign people were turning to its products to connect with loved ones.\"Teresi thinks Meta has a 60 percent shot at winning the trial, although he criticized Meta's seeming defense that any company competing for online ad dollars competes with Meta. That argument may have broadened the market definition too much, he suggested.\"If you’re saying that the relevant market here is competing for advertising dollars, then you could throw anything in there,\" Teresi said. \"You could throw TV in there, you could throw print in there if you wanted to, and there’s really no end to that concept.\"Allensworth was less confident in Meta's chances, telling Bloomberg, \"I really actually think this could go either way.\"Ashley BelangerSenior Policy ReporterAshley BelangerSenior Policy ReporterAshley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated to tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.

But by analyzing observations made by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope over a 20-year period, a research team from the University of Arizona and other institutions hasprovided new insightsinto the composition and dynamics of the planet’s atmosphere.Information about Uranus is limited. What we know is that the planet is composed mainly of water and ammonia ice, its diameter is about 51,000 kilometers, about four times that of the Earth, and its mass is about 15 times greater than Earth’s. Uranus also has13 rings and 28 satellites.In January 1986, NASA’s Voyager 2 space probe successfully completed what has been, to date, the only exploration of the planet, conducting a flyby as part of its mission to study the outer planets of the Solar System.This image of Uranus was taken by NASA’s Voyager 2 space probe in January 1986.Credit:NASA/JPLThis image of Uranus was taken by NASA’s Voyager 2 space probe in January 1986.Credit:NASA/JPLBut thanks to this new research, we now know a little more about this icy giant. According to the research, which assessed Hubble images taken between 2002 and 2022, the main components of Uranus’ atmosphere are hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane and very small amounts of water and ammonia. Uranus appears pale blue-green because methane absorbs the red component of sunlight.This image of Uranus, taken by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, shows nine of the planet’s 28 satellites and its rings.Credit:NASA/ESA/CSA/STSCIThis image of Uranus, taken by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, shows nine of the planet’s 28 satellites and its rings.Credit:NASA/ESA/CSA/STSCIThe research has also shed light on the planet’s seasons.Unlike all of the other planets in the Solar System, Uranus’ axis of rotation is almost parallel to its orbital plane. For this reason, Uranus is said to be orbiting in an “overturned” position, as shown in the picture below.It is hypothesized thatthis may be due to a collision with an Earth-sized object in the past.Uranus orbiting the Sun. It can be seen that Uranus’ axis of rotation is almost parallel to its orbital plane.Credit:NASA/ESA/J. Feild (STSCI)Uranus orbiting the Sun. It can be seen that Uranus’ axis of rotation is almost parallel to its orbital plane.Credit:NASA/ESA/J. Feild (STSCI)The planet’s orbital period is about 84 years, which means that, for a specific point on the surface, the period when the sun shines (some of spring, summer, and some of fall) lasts about 42 years, and the period when the sun does not shine (some of fall, winter, and some of spring) lasts for about 42 years as well. In this study, the research team spent 20 years observing the seasons.Over that period, the research team watched as the south polar region darkened going into winter and the north polar region brightened as summer approached. By observing the planet at four different points in time, years apart, they could see how the gradual shifting of the seasons affected the planet. The top row shows how the planet appeared when viewing it with just visible light.These images of Uranus were taken by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope using its Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS).Credit:NASA/ESA/Erich Karkoschka (LPL)These images of Uranus were taken by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope using its Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS).Credit:NASA/ESA/Erich Karkoschka (LPL)The second row from the top is a pseudo-color image based on visible-light and near-infrared observations. Green indicates less methane in the atmosphere than blue, and red indicates the absence of methane. The lower levels of atmospheric methane at the poles (which, remember, are on the planet’s sides rather than its top and bottom) indicate that there is little seasonal variation in methane levels. In the left-most image on this row, the green-colored south pole is moving into darkness. In the other three images, the green, lower-methane region of the north pole can be seen coming into view. (The fourth row shows the same lack of methane variation, but without coloration.)But what about the third row? This shows estimates of aerosol abundance, using visible light and infrared images that haven’t been colored. The light areas are cloudy with high aerosol abundance, and the dark areas are clear with low aerosol abundance. What is noteworthy in these images is that thereisseasonal variation. The arctic region was clear at the beginning of spring (in 2002), but became cloudy as summer progressed (2012 through 2022). Conversely, the antarctic region appears to have cleared as fall progressed into winter. The team hypothesizes that these seasonal changes are evidence that sunlight changes levels of aerosol mist on the planet.Although the results of this study cover a long 20-year period, this still only reflects one period of seasonal change in Uranus’ atmosphere. The research team will continue to observe Uranus as the polar regions move into new seasons to gather more data.This story originally appeared onWIRED Japanand has been translated from Japanese.Shigeyuki Hando, Wired JapanShigeyuki Hando, Wired JapanWired.com is your essential daily guide to what's next, delivering the most original and complete take you'll find anywhere on innovation's impact on technology, science, business and culture.59 Comments",

    "content": "Text settingsStory textSizeSmallStandardLargeWidth*StandardWideLinksStandardOrange* Subscribers onlyLearn moreMinimize to navAt this point,Elden Ringis well-known for its epic sense of scale, offering players dozens of hours of meticulous exploration, gradual character progression, andunforgiving enemy encountersthat require deliberate care and strategy. On its face, this doesn't seem like the best basis for a semi-randomized multiplayer action game spin-off with strict time limits and an ever-encroaching physical border in a tightly constrained map.Somehow, though,Elden Ring: Nightreignmakes the combination work. The game condenses all the essential parts ofElden Ringdown to their barest essence, tweaking things just enough to distill the flavor of a full-fledgedElden Ringplaythrough into zippy runs of less than an hour each. The result is a fast-paced, quick-hit shot of adventuring that is well suited to repeated play with friends.Fort-elden Ring-niteThe initial moments of eachNightreignrun draw an almost comical comparison toFortnite, with each player dropping into the game's singular map by hanging off the talons of a great spectral eagle. Once on the ground, players have to stay inside a circular \"safe zone\" that will slowly contract throughout each of two quick in-game days, forcing your party toward an eventual encounter with a mini-boss at the end of each day. If you survive both days, you take on one of the several extremely punishing Nightlords you chose to face at the beginning of that run.It's not exactly a floating bus, but it kind of feels like it is...Credit: Bandai NamcoIt's not exactly a floating bus, but it kind of feels like it is...Credit: Bandai NamcoIf you've playedElden Ring, you'll definitely recognize the general fallen world aesthetic here, as well as many specific enemies and items taken directly from FromSoft's previous epic. What will be less familiar is the general pace of play, which is guided by that encroaching circle of deadly blue flame. Instead of taking your time and exploring every nook and cranny for hidden secrets, you end up dashing between points of interest highlighted on the map in a madcap attempt to farm enough experience points and powerful items to have a chance against the big bosses.There are a few crucial tweaks to theElden Ringformula aiding you in this newly speed-focused effort. For one thing, your character now has an unlimited \"surge sprint\" that can get you from one part of the map to another at a pretty rapid clip. For another, there's a nice springy wall jump that lets you climb up stair-step cliffs and walls that are much taller than your character. Add in occasional jump pads for quickly leaping over cliffs and a complete lack of fall damage for descending into valleys, and you get a game that feels more like a 3DSonicthanElden Ringat points.You'd better have a few levels under your belt if you're going to take on a battle like this.Credit: Bandai NamcoYou'd better have a few levels under your belt if you're going to take on a battle like this.Credit: Bandai NamcoThings feel more like the oldElden Ringduring battles, where you'll quickly fall into the familiar rhythm of managing limited stamina to attack, block, and dodge enemies' heavily telegraphed attacks. Even here, though, things feel a little more action-oriented thanks to powerful, class-specific \"character skills\" and \"ultimate art\" attacks that slowly recharge over time. The quick pace of leveling also aids in the power fantasy, condensing the progression from zero to hero into an extremely tight time frame, relative toElden Ringproper.Try, try againSpeaking of classes, the eight options here tend to fall into the usual archetypes for this kind of action-adventure game: the tank, the mage, the defensive specialist, the dextrous dodger, etc. For myself, I tended toward the Ironeye class, with an unlimited supply of arrows that let me deliver consistent (if relatively weak) damage against flying and/or zigzagging bosses, all while maintaining a safe range from all but the widest-ranged attacks.But one big benefit ofNightreign's faster-paced design is that you don't have to tie yourself to a specific class for hundreds of hours at the outset. You'll get ample opportunity to try them all—and different combinations with teammate classes—across dozens of individual, bite-size runs.As you do, you'll start to learn the general shape of the map, which is well-designed with a few distinct geographic regions and points of interest. While the specific enemies and items you'll find in various locations will change from run to run, you'll quickly develop a feel for the landmarks and general routes you'll want to at least consider exploring each time.After a few runs, you'll know where to find the subterranean caves that have a good chance of hidden loot.After a few runs, you'll know where to find the subterranean caves that have a good chance of hidden loot.Repeated runs also help you develop the key sense of when it's worthwhile to fight and when it makes more sense to run away. This is especially important at the beginning of each run, where your low-level character needs to focus on farming fodder enemies until you are powerful enough to take on the lowest tier of sub-bosses you might stumble across. Later in the run, you'll need to shift to ignoring those low-level enemies so you can spend more time gaining big rewards from the even bigger bosses.Even with a decent general strategy, though, players shouldn't expect to be able to win every run inNightreign. During some runs, you may find only garbage weapon drops or low-level enemies that make it hard to quickly build up the critical mass of power you'll need by the final encounter. During other runs, you may chance upon a great weapon that causes enough bleed damage to make even the most difficult bosses relatively easy to kill.Then there are the runs where you get greedy by doubling back to a lucrative encounter on the edge of the safety circle, only to find yourself quickly engulfed in blue flame. Or the ones where you take one wrong step and fall to your doom down a cliffside while trying to dodge away from a relatively harmless enemy, losing a crucial character level (and your momentum) when you respawn.Between runs, you can equip relics that offer small permanent stat boosts to the various classes. In general, though, success inNightreignis a matter of keeping at it until you stumble on the right mix of luck and execution to finally best the Nightlords.Find a friendWhileNightreigntechnically has a single-player mode, the game is quite explicitly designed for groups of three simultaneous humans (groups of two need not apply—paired players will need to join up with a third). Being in a threesome generally means that one player can draw an enemy's attack while the other two take advantage by flanking around their guard. It also means that downed players can be revived by a partner repeatedly hitting their crawling near-corpse with a weapon, an awkward and hilarious process in practice.Does this count as three-on-one odds, or do the multiple heads on the beast make it more of a fair fight?Does this count as three-on-one odds, or do the multiple heads on the beast make it more of a fair fight?Being able to coordinate with your teammates is crucial both during battles and as you decide which location to explore next in the ever-narrowing circle of the available map. If you're not playing with friends and chatting over a voice connection, your main form of communication is an awkward system of pinning points of interest on the map.Unfortunately, I ran into some serious problems with lag in my pre-release multiplayer runs, with the game periodically freezing for multiple seconds at a time as the servers struggled to keep up. I often came out of these freezes to find I had succumbed to an enemy attack that I hadn't even seen on my screen. I can't say this server performance in a tightly controlled pre-launch environment bodes well for how the game will perform once the wider public gains access in a few days.Those technical problems aside, I was surprised at how well this zippy, capsule-size take on theElden Ringformula worked in practice.Nightreignmight not be the full-fledged, epicElden Ringsequel that long-time \"Soulsborne\" fans are looking for, but it's still a compelling, action-packed twist on the popular adventure gameplay.Kyle OrlandSenior Gaming EditorKyle OrlandSenior Gaming EditorKyle Orland has been the Senior Gaming Editor at Ars Technica since 2012, writing primarily about the business, tech, and culture behind video games.

    "content": "Text settingsStory textSizeSmallStandardLargeWidth*StandardWideLinksStandardOrange* Subscribers onlyLearn moreMinimize to navFor the last three months or so, I've been learning to use (and love) a Bambu Labs A1 3D printer, a big, loud machine that sits on my desk and turns pictures on my computer screen into real-world objects.Inthe first partof my series about diving into the wild world of 3D printers, I covered what I'd learned about the different types of 3D printers, some useful settings in the Bambu Studio app (which should also be broadly useful to know about no matter what printer you use), and some initial, magical-feeling successes in downloading files that I turned into useful physical items using a few feet of plastic filament and a couple hours of time.For this second part, I'm focusing on what I learned when I embarked on my first major project—printing upgrade parts for the A1withthe A1. It was here that I made some of my first big 3D printing mistakes, mistakes that prompted me to read up on the different kinds of 3D printer filament, what each type of filament is good for, and which types the A1 is (and is not) good at handling as an un-enclosed, bed-slinging printer.As with the information in part one, I share this with you not because it is groundbreaking but because there's a lot of information out there, and it can be an intimidating hobby to break into. By sharing what I learned and what I found useful early in my journey, I hope I can help other people who have been debating whether to take the plunge.Adventures in recursion: 3D-printing 3D printer partsA display cover for the A1's screen will protect it from wear and tear and allow you to easily hide it when you want to.Credit: Andrew CunninghamMy very first project was a holder for my office's ceiling fan remote. My second, similarly, was a wall-mounted holder for the Xbox gamepad and wired headset I use with my gaming PC, which normally just had to float around loose on my desk when I wasn't using them.These were both relatively quick, simple prints that showed the printer was working like it was supposed to—all of the built-in temperature settings, the textured PEI plate, the printer's calibration and auto-bed-leveling routines added up to make simple prints as dead-easy as Bambu promised they would be. It made me eager to seek out other prints, including stuff onthe Makerworld siteI hadn't thought to try yet.The first problem I had? Well, as part of its pre-print warmup routine, the A1 spits a couple of grams of filament out and tosses it to the side. This is totally normal—it's called \"purging,\" and it gets rid of filament that's gone brittle from being heated too long. If you're changing colors, it also clears any last bits of the previous color that are still in the nozzle. But it didn't seem particularly elegant to have the printer eternally launching little knots of plastic onto my desk.The A1's default design just ejects little molten wads of plastic all over your desk when it's changing or purging filament. This is one of many waste bin (or \"poop bucket\") designs made to catch and store these bits and pieces.Credit: Andrew CunninghamThe solution to this was to 3D-print a purging bucket for the A1 (also referred to, of course, as a \"poop bucket\" or \"poop chute.\") In fact, there are tons of purging buckets designed specifically for the A1 because it's a fairly popular budget model and there's nothing stopping people from making parts that fit it like a glove.I printed this bucket, as well as an additional little bracket that would \"catch\" the purged filament and make sure it fell into the bucket. And this opened the door to my first major printing project: printing additional parts for the printer itself.Itook to YouTubeand watched a couple of videos on the topic because I'm apparently far from the first person who has had this reaction to the A1. After much watching and reading, here are the parts I ended up printing:Bambu Lab AMS Lite Top Mount and Z-Axis Stiffener: The Lite version of Bambu's Automated Materials System (AMS) is the optional accessory that enables multi-color printing for the A1. And like the A1 itself, it's a lower-cost, open-air version of the AMS that works with Bambu's more expensive printers.The AMS Lite comes with a stand that you can use to set it next to the A1, but that's more horizontal space than I had to spare. This top mount is Bambu's official solution for putting the AMS Lite on top of the A1 instead, saving you some space.The top mount actually has two important components: the top mount itself and a \"Z-Axis Stiffener,\" a pair of legs that extend behind the A1 to make the whole thing more stable on a desk or table. Bambu already recommends 195 mm (or 7.7 inches) of \"safety margin\" behind the A1 to give the bed room to sling, so if you've left that much space behind the printer, you probably have enough space for these legs.After installing all of these parts, the top mount, and a fully loaded AMS, it's probably a good idea to run the printer's calibration cycle again to account for the difference in balance.You may want to print the top mount itself with PETG, which is a bit stronger and more impact-resistant than PLA plastic.A1 Purge Waste Bin and Deflector, by jimbobble. There are approximately 1 million different A1 purge bucket designs, each with its own appeal. But this one is large and simple and includes a version that is compatible with the printer Z-Axis Stiffener legs.A1 rectangular fan cover, by Arzhang Lotfi. There are a bunch of options for this, including fun ones, but you can find dozens of simple grille designs that snap in place and protect the fan on the A1's print head.Bambu A1 Adjustable Camera Holder, by mlodybuk: This one's a little more complicated because it does require some potentially warranty-voiding disassembly of components. The A1's camera is also pretty awful no matter how you position it, with sub-1 FPS video that's just barely suitable for checking on whether a print has been ruined or not.But if you want to use it, I'd highly recommend moving it from the default location, which is low down and at an odd angle, so you're not getting the best view of your print that you can.This print includes a redesigned cover for the camera area, a filler piece to fill the hole where the camerausedto be to keep dust and other things from getting inside the printer, and a small camera receptacle that snaps in place onto the new cover and can be turned up and down.If you're not comfortable modding your machine like this, the camera is livable as-is, but this got me a much better vantage point on my prints.With a little effort, this print allows you to reposition the A1's camera, giving you a better angle on your prints and making it adjustable.Credit: Andrew CunninghamA1 Screen Protector New Release, by Rox3D: Not strictly necessary, but an unobtrusive way to protect (and to \"turn off\") the A1's built-in LCD screen when it's not in use. The hinge mechanism of this print is stiff enough that the screen cover can be lifted partway without flopping back down.A1 X-Axis Cover, by Moria3DPStudio: Another only-if-you-want-it print, this foldable cover slides over the A1's exposed rail when you're not using it. Just make sure you take it back off before you try to print anything—it won't break anything, but the printer won't be happy with you. Not that I'm speaking from experience.Ultimate Filament Spool Enclosure for the AMS Lite, by Supergrapher: Here's the big one, and it's a true learning experience for all kinds of things. The regular Bambu AMS system for the P- and X-series printers is enclosed, which is useful not just for keeping dust from settling on your filament spools but for controlling humidity and keeping spools you've dried from re-absorbing moisture. There's no first-party enclosure for the AMS Lite, but this user-created enclosure is flexible and popular, and it can be used to enclose the AMS Lite whether you have it mounted on top of or to the side of the A1. The small plastic clips that keep the lids on are mildly irritating to pop on and off, relative to a lid that you can just lift up and put back down, but the benefits are worth it.3D Disc for A1 - \"Pokéball,\"by BS 3D Print: One of the few purely cosmetic parts I've printed. The little spinning bit on the front of the A1's print head shows you when the filament is being extruded, but it's not a functional part. This is just one of dozens and dozens of cosmetic replacements for it if you choose to pop it off.Sturdy Modular Filament Spool Rack, by Antiphrasis: Not technically an upgrade for the A1, but an easy recommendation for any new 3D printers who suddenly find themselves with a rainbow of a dozen-plus different filaments you want to try. Each shelf here holds three spools of filament, and you can print additional shelves to spread them out either horizontally, vertically, or both, so you can make something that exactly meets your needs and fits your space. A two-by-three shelf gave me room for 18 spools, and I can print more if I need them.There are some things that others recommend for the A1 that I haven't printed yet—mainly guides for cables, vibration dampeners for the base, and things to reinforce areas of possible stress for the print head and the A1's loose, dangly wire.Part of the fun is figuring out what your problems are, identifying prints that could help solve the problem, and then trying them out to see if theydosolve your problem. (The parts have also given my A1 its purple accents, since a bright purple roll of filament was one of the first ones my 5-year-old wanted to get.)Early mistakesThe \"Z-Axis stiffener,\" an extra set of legs for the A1 that Bambu recommends if you top-mount your AMS Lite. This took me three tries to print, mainly because of my own inexperience.Credit: Andrew CunninghamPrinting each of these parts gave me a solid crash course into common pitfalls and rookie mistakes.For example, did you know that ABS plastic doesn't print well on an open-bed printer? Well, it doesn't! But I didn't know that when I bought a spool of ABS to print some parts that I wanted to be sturdier and more resistant to wear and tear. I'd open the window and leave the room to deal with the fumes and be fine, I figured.I tried printing the Z-Axis Stiffener supports for the A1 in ABS, but they went wonky. Lower bed temperature and (especially) ambient temperature tends to make ABS warp and curl upward, and extrusion-based printers rely on precision to do their thing. Once a layer—any layer!—gets screwed up during a print, that will reverberate throughout the entire rest of the object. Which is why my first attempt at supports ended up being totally unusable.Large ABS plastic prints are tough to do on an open-bed printer. You can see here how that lower-left corner peeled upward slightly from the print bed, and any unevenness in the foundation of your print is going to reverberate in the layers that are higher up.Credit: Andrew CunninghamI then tried printing another set of supports with PLA plastic, ones that claimed to maintain their sturdiness while using less infill (that is, how much plastic is actually used inside the print to give it rigidity—around 15 percent is typically a good balance between rigidity and wasting plastic that you'll never see, though there may be times when you want more or less). I'm still not sure what I did, but the prints I got were squishy and crunchy to the touch, a clear sign that the amount and/or type of infill wasn't sufficient. It wasn't until my third try—the original Bambu-made supports, in PLA instead of ABS—that I made supports I could actually use.An attempt at printing the same part with PLA, but with insufficient infill plastic that left my surfaces rough and the interiors fragile and crunchy. I canceled this one about halfway through when it became clear that something wasn't right.Credit: Andrew CunninghamAfter much reading and research, I learned that for most things, PETG plastic is what you use if you want to make sturdier (and outdoor-friendly) prints on an open bed. Great! I decided I'd print most of the A1 ABS enclosure with clear PETG filament to make something durable that I could also see through when I wanted to see how much filament was left on a given spool.This ended up being a tricky first experiment with PETG plastic for three different reasons. For one, printing \"clear\" PETG that actually looks clear is best done with a larger nozzle (Bambu offers 0.2 mm, 0.6 mm, and 0.8 mm nozzles for the A1, in addition to the default 0.4 mm) because you can get the same work done in fewer layers, and the more layers you have, the less \"clear\" that clear plastic will be. Fine!The Inland-brand clear PETG+ I bought from our local Micro Center also didn't love the default temperature settings for generic PETG that the A1 uses, both for the heatbed and the filament itself; plastic flowed unevenly from the nozzle and was prone to coming detached from the bed. If this is happening to you (or if you want to experiment withloweringyour temperatures to save a bit of energy), going into Bambu Studio, nudging temperatures by 5 degrees in either direction, and trying a quick test print (I likethis one) helped me dial in my settings when using unfamiliar filament.This homebrewed enclosure for the AMS Lite multi-color filament switcher (and the top mount that sticks it on the top of the printer) has been my biggest and most complex print to date. An 0.8 mm nozzle and some settings changes are recommended to maximize the transparency of transparent PETG filament.Credit: Andrew CunninghamFinally, PETG is especially prone to absorbing ambient moisture. When that moisture hits a 260° nozzle, it quickly evaporates, and that can interfere with the evenness of the flow rate and the cleanliness of your print (this usually manifests as \"stringing,\" fine, almost cotton-y strands that hang off your finished prints).You can buy dedicated filament drying boxes or stick spools in an oven at a low temperature for a few hours if this really bothers you or if it's significant enough to affect the quality of your prints. One of the reasons to have an enclosure is to create a humidity-controlled environment to keep your spools from absorbing too much moisture in the first place.The temperature and nozzle-size adjustments made me happy enough with my PETG prints that I was fine to pick off the little fuzzy stringers that were on my prints afterward, but your mileage may vary.These are just a few examples of the kinds of things you learn if you jump in with both feet and experiment with different prints and plastics in rapid succession. Hopefully, this advice helps you avoid myspecificmistakes. But the main takeaway is that experience is the best teacher.The wide world of plasticsI used filament to print a modular filament shelf for my filaments.Credit: Andrew CunninghamMy wife had gotten me two spools of filament, a white and a black spool of Bambu's own PLA Basic. What does all of that mean?No matter what you're buying, it's most commonly sold in 1 kilogram spools (the weight of the plastic, not the plastic and the spool together). Each thing you print will give you an estimate of how much filament, in grams, you'll need to print it.There are quite a few different types of plastics out there, on Bambu's site and in other stores. But here are the big ones I found out about almost immediately:Polylactic acid, or PLABy far the most commonly used plastic, PLA is inexpensive, available in a huge rainbow of colors and textures, and has a relatively low melting point, making it an easy material for most 3D printers to work with. It's made of renewable material rather than petroleum, which makes it marginally more environmentally friendly than some other kinds of plastic. And it's easy to \"finish\" PLA-printed parts if you're trying to make props, toys, or other objects that you don't want to have that 3D printed look about them, whether you're sanding those parts or using a chemical to smooth the finish.The downside is that it's not particularly resilient—sitting in a hot car or in direct sunlight for very long is enough to melt or warp it, which makes it a bad choice for anything that needs to survive outdoors or anything load-bearing. Its environmental bona fidesare also a bit oversold—itisbiodegradable, but it doesn't do so quickly outside of specialized composting facilities. If you throw it in the trash and it goes to a landfill, it will still take its time returning to nature.You'll find a ton of different kinds of PLA out there. Some have additives that give them a matte or silky texture. Some have little particles of wood or metal or evencoffeeorspent beer grainsembedded in them, meant to endow 3D printed objects with the look, feel, or smell of those materials.Some PLA just has… some other kind of unspecified additive in it. You’ll see “PLA+” all over the place, but as far as I can tell, there is no industry-wide agreed-upon standard for what the plus is supposed to mean. Manufacturers sometimes claim it’s stronger than regular PLA; other terms like “PLA Pro” and “PLA Max” are similarly non-standardized and vague.Polyethylene terephthalate glycol, or PETGPET is a common household plastic, and you'll find it in everything from clothing fibers to soda bottles. PETG is the same material, with ethylene glycol (the \"G\") added to lower the melting point and make it less prone to crystallizing and warping. It also makes it more transparent, though trying to print anything truly \"transparent\" with an extrusion printer is difficult.PETG has a higher melting point than PLA, but it's still lower than other kinds of plastics. This makes PETG a good middle ground for some types of printing. It's better than PLA for functional load-bearing parts and outdoor use because it's stronger and able to bend a bit without warping, but it's still malleable enough to print well on all kinds of home 3D printers.PETG can still be fussier to work with than PLA. I more frequently had issues with the edges of my PETG prints coming unstuck from the bed of the printer before the print was done.PETG filament is also especially susceptible to absorbing moisture from the air, which can make extrusion messier. My PETG prints have usually had lots of little wispy strings of plastic hanging off them by the end—not enough to affect the strength or utility of the thing I’ve printed but enough that I needed to pull the strings off to clean up the print once it was done.Drying the filament properlycould help with that if I ever need the prints to be cleaner in the first place.It's also worth noting that PETG is the strongest kind of filament that an open-bed printer like the A1 can handle reliably. Youcansucceed with other plastics, but Reddit anecdotes, my own personal experience, andBambu's filament guideall point to a higher level of difficulty.Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, or ABS\"Going to look at the filament wall at Micro Center\" is a legit father-son activity at this point.Credit: Andrew CunninghamYou probably have a lot of ABS plastic in your life. Game consoles and controllers, the plastic keys onmostkeyboards, Lego bricks, appliances, plastic board game pieces—it's mostly ABS.Thin layers of ABS stuck together aren't as strong or durable as commercially manufactured injection-molded ABS, but it's still more heat-resistant and durable than 3D-printed PLA or PETG.There are two big issues specific to ABS, which are also outlined inBambu's FAQ for the A1. The first is that it doesn't print well on an open-bed printer, especially for larger prints. The corners are more prone to pulling up off the print bed, and as with a house, any problems in your foundation will reverberate throughout the rest of your print.The second is fumes. All 3D-printed plastics emit fumes when they've been melted, and a good rule of thumb is to at least print things in a room where you can open the window (and not in a room where anyone or anything sleeps). But ABS and ASA plastics in particular can emit fumes that cause eye and respiratory irritation, headaches, and nausea if you're printing them indoors with insufficient ventilation.As for what quantity of printing counts as \"dangerous,\" there's no real consensus, and thestudiesthat have beendonemostly land in inconclusive \"further study is needed\" territory. At a bare minimum, it's considered a best practice to at least be able to open a window if you're printing with ABS or to use a closed-bed printer in an unoccupied part of your home, like a garage, shed, or workshop space (if you have one).Acrylonitrile styrene acrylate, or ASADescribed to me by Ars colleague Lee Hutchinson as \"ABS but with more UV resistance,\" this material is even better suited for outdoor applications than the other plastics on this list.But also like ABS, you'll have a hard time getting good results with an open-bed printer, and the fumes are more harmful to inhale. You'll want a closed-bed printer and decent ventilation for good results.Thermoplastic polyurethane, or TPUTPU is best known for its flexibility relative to the other kinds of plastics on this list. It doesn't get as brittle when it's cold and has more impact-resistance, and it can print reasonably well on an open-bed printer.One downside of TPU is that you need to print slowly to get reliably good results—a pain, when even relatively simple fidget toys can take an hour or two to print at full speed using PLA. Longer prints mean more power use and more opportunities for your print to peel off the print bed. A roll of TPU filament will also usually run you a few dollars more than a roll of PLA, PETG, or ABS.First- or third-party filament?The first-party Bambu spools have RFID chips in them that Bambu printers can scan to automatically show the type and color of filament that it is and to keep track of how much filament you have remaining. Bambu also has temperature and speed presets for all of its first-party filaments built into the printer and the Bambu Studio software. There are presets for a few other filament brands in the printer, but I usually ended up using the \"generic\" presets, which may need some tuning to ensure the best possible adhesion to the print bed and extrusion from the nozzle.I mostly ended up using Inland-branded filament I picked up from my local Micro Center—both because it's cheaper than Bambu's first-party stuff and because it's faster and easier for me to get to. If you don't have a brick-and-mortar hobby store with filaments in stock, the A1 and other printers sometimes come with some sample filament swatches so you can see the texture and color of the stuff you're buying online.What’s next?Part of the fun of 3D printing is that it can be used for a wide array of projects—organizing your desk or your kitchen, printing out little fidget-toy favors for your kid's birthday party, printing out replacement parts for little plastic bits and bobs that have broken, or just printing out decorations and other objects you'll enjoy looking at.Once you're armed with all of the basic information in this guide, the next step is really up to you. What would you find fun or useful? What do you need? How can 3D printing help you with other household tasks or hobbies that you might be trying to break into? For the last part of this series, the Ars staffers with 3D printers at home will share some of their favorite prints—hearing people talk about what they'd done themselves really opened my eyes to the possibilities and the utility of these devices, and more personal testimonials may help those of you who are on the fence to climb down off of it.Andrew CunninghamSenior Technology ReporterAndrew CunninghamSenior Technology ReporterAndrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

The rocket is complex and gargantuan, wider and longer than a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, and after nearly two years of steady progress since its first test flight in 2023, this has been a year of setbacks for Starship.During the rocket's two previous test flights—each using an upgraded \"Block 2\" Starship design—problems in the ship's propulsion systemled to leaks during launch, eventually triggering an early shutdown of the rocket's main engines. On both flights, the vehicle spun out of control and broke apart, spreading debris over an area near the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.The good news is that that didn't happen on Tuesday. The ship's main engines fired for their full duration, putting the vehicle on its expected trajectory toward a splashdown in the Indian Ocean. For a short time, it appeared the ship was on track for a successful flight.\"Starship made it to the scheduled ship engine cutoff, so big improvement over last flight! Also, no significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent,\"wrote Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO, on X.The bad news is that Tuesday's test flight revealed more problems, preventing SpaceX from achieving the most importantgoals Musk outlined going into the launch.\"Leaks caused loss of main tank pressure during the coast and reentry phase,\" Musk posted on X. \"Lot of good data to review.\"With the loss of tank pressure, the rocket started slowly spinning as it coasted through the blackness of space more than 100 miles above the Earth. This loss of control spelled another premature end to a Starship test flight.Most notable among the flight's unmet objectives was SpaceX's desire to study the performance of the ship's heat shield, which includes improved heat-absorbing tiles to better withstand the scorching temperatures of reentry back into the atmosphere.\"The most important thing is data on how to improve the tile design, so it's basically data during the high heating, reentry phase in order to improve the tiles for the next iteration,\" Musktold Ars Technicabefore Tuesday's flight. \"So we've got like a dozen or more tile experiments. We're trying different coatings on tiles. We're trying different fabrication techniques, different attachment techniques. We're varying the gap filler for the tiles.\"Engineers are hungry for data on the changes to the heat shield, which can't be fully tested on the ground. SpaceX officials hope the new tiles will be more robust than the ones flown on the first-generation, or Block 1, version of Starship, allowing future ships to land and quickly launch again, without the need for time-consuming inspections, refurbishment, and in some cases, tile replacements. This is a core tenet of SpaceX's plans for Starship, which include delivering astronauts to the surface of the Moon, proliferating low-Earth orbit with refueling tankers, and eventually helping establish a settlement on Mars, all of which are predicated on rapid reusability of Starship and its Super Heavy booster.Last year, SpaceX successfully landed three Starships in the Indian Ocean after they survived hellish reentries, but they came down with damaged heat shields. After an early end to Tuesday's test flight, SpaceX's heat shield engineers will have to wait a while longer to satiate their appetites. And the longer they have to wait, the longer the wait for other important Starship developmental tests, such as a full orbital flight, in-space refueling, and recovery and reuse of the ship itself, replicating what SpaceX has now accomplished with the Super Heavy booster.Failing forward or falling short?The ninth flight of Starship began with a booming departure from SpaceX's Starbase launch site at 6:35 pm CDT (7:35 pm EDT; 23:35 UTC) on Tuesday.After a brief hold to resolve last-minute technical glitches, SpaceX resumed the countdown clock to tick away the final seconds before liftoff. A gush of water poured over the deck of the launch pad just before 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines ignited on the rocket's massive Super Heavy first-stage booster. Once all 33 engines lit, the enormous stainless steel rocket—towering more than 400 feet (123 meters)—began to climb away from Starbase.SpaceX's Starship rocket, flying with a reused first-stage booster for the first time, climbs away from Starbase, Texas.Credit: SpaceXHeading east, the Super Heavy booster produced more than twice the power of NASA's Saturn V rocket, an icon of the Apollo Moon program, as it soared over the Gulf of Mexico. After two-and-a-half minutes, the Raptor engines switched off and the Super Heavy booster separated from Starship's upper stage.Six Raptor engines fired on the ship to continue pushing it into space. As the booster started maneuvering for an attempt to target an intact splashdown in the sea, the ship burned its engines for more than six minutes, reaching a top speed of 16,462 mph (26,493 kilometers per hour), right in line with preflight predictions.A member of SpaceX's launch team declared \"nominal orbit insertion\" a little more than nine minutes into the flight, indicating the rocket reached its planned trajectory, just shy of the velocity required to enter a stable orbit around the Earth.The flight profile was supposed to take Starship halfway around the world, with the mission culminating in a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean northwest of Australia. But a few minutes after engine shutdown, the ship started to diverge from SpaceX's flight plan.First, SpaceX aborted an attempt to release eight simulated Starlink Internet satellites in the first test of the Starship's payload deployer. The cargo bay door would not fully open, and engineers called off the demonstration, according to Dan Huot, a member of SpaceX's communications team who hosted the company's live launch broadcast Tuesday.That alone would not have been a big deal. However, a few minutes later, Huot made a more troubling announcement.\"We are in a little bit of a spin,\" he said. \"We did spring a leak in some of the fuel tank systems inside of Starship, which a lot of those are used for attitude control. So, at this point, we’ve essentially lost our attitude control with Starship.\"This eliminated any chance for a controlled reentry and an opportunity to thoroughly scrutinize the performance of Starship's heat shield. The spin also prevented a brief restart of one of the ship's Raptor engines in space.\"Not looking great for a lot of our on-orbit objectives for today,\" Huot said.SpaceX continued streaming live video from Starship as it soared over the Atlantic Ocean and Africa. Then, a blanket of superheated plasma enveloped the vehicle as it plunged into the atmosphere. Still in a slow tumble, the ship started shedding scorched chunks of its skin before the screen went black. SpaceX lost contact with the vehicle around 46 minutes into the flight. The ship likely broke apart over the Indian Ocean, dropping debris into a remote swath of sea within its expected flight corridor.Victories where you find themAlthough the flight did not end as well as SpaceX officials hoped, the company made some tangible progress Tuesday. Most importantly, it broke the streak of back-to-back launch failures on Starship's two most recent test flights in January and March.SpaceX's investigation earlier this year into a January 16 launch failure concluded that vibrations likely triggered fuel leaks and fires in the ship's engine compartment, causing an early shutdown of the rocket's engines. Engineers said the vibrations were likely in resonance with the vehicle's natural frequency, intensifying the shaking beyond the levels SpaceX predicted.Engineers made fixes and launched the next Starship test flight on March 6, but it again encountered trouble midway through the ship's main engine burn. SpaceX said earlier this month that the inquiry into the March 6 failure found its most probable root cause was a hardware failure in one of the upper stage's center engines, resulting in \"inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition.\"In its official statement, the company was silent on the nature of the hardware failure but said engines for future test flights will receive additional preload on key joints, a new nitrogen purge system, and improvements to the propellant drain system. A new generation of Raptor engines, known as Raptor 3, should begin flying around the end of this year with additional improvements to address the failure mechanism, SpaceX said.Another bright spot in Tuesday's test flight was that it marked the first time SpaceX reused a Super Heavy booster from a prior launch. The booster used Tuesday previously launched on Starship's seventh test flight in January before it was caught back at the launch pad and refurbished for another space shot.Booster 14 comes in for the catch after flying to the edge of space on January 16. SpaceX flew this booster again Tuesday but did not attempt a catch.Credit: SpaceXAfter releasing the Starship upper stage to continue its journey into space, the Super Heavy booster flipped around to fly tail-first and reignited 13 of its engines to begin boosting itself back toward the South Texas coast. On this test flight, SpaceX aimed the booster for a hard splashdown in the ocean just offshore from Starbase, rather than a mid-air catch back at the launch pad, which SpaceX accomplished on three of its four most recent test flights.SpaceX made the change for a few reasons. First, engineers programmed the booster to fly at a higher angle of attack during its descent, increasing the amount of atmospheric drag on the vehicle compared to past flights. This change should reduce propellant usage on the booster's landing burn, which occurs just before the rocket is caught by the launch pad's mechanical arms, or \"chopsticks,\" on a recovery flight.During the landing burn itself, engineers wanted to demonstrate the booster's ability to respond to an engine failure on descent by using just two of the rocket's 33 engines for the end of the burn, rather than the usual three. Instead, the rocket appeared to explode around the beginning of the landing burn before it could complete the final landing maneuver.Before the explosion at the end of its flight, the booster appeared to fly as designed. Data displayed on SpaceX's live broadcast of the launch showed all 33 of the rocket's engines fired normally during its initial ascent from Texas, a reassuring sign for the reliability of the Super Heavy booster.SpaceX kicked off the year with the ambition to launch as many as 25 Starship test flights in 2025, a goal that now seems to be unattainable. However, an X post by Musk on Tuesday night suggested a faster cadence of launches in the coming months. He said the next three Starships could launch at intervals of about once every three to four weeks. After that, SpaceX is expected to transition to a third-generation, or Block 3, Starship design with more changes.It wasn't immediately clear how long it might take SpaceX to correct whatever problems caused Tuesday's test flight woes. The Starship vehicle for the next flight is already built and completed cryogenic prooftesting on April 27. For the last few ships, SpaceX has completed this cryogenic testing milestone around one-and-a-half to three months prior to launch.A spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration said the agency is \"actively working\" with SpaceX in the aftermath of Tuesday's test flight but did not say if the FAA will require SpaceX to conduct a formal mishap investigation.Shana Diez, director of Starship engineering at SpaceX, chimed in with herown post on X. Based on preliminary data from Tuesday's flight, she is optimistic the next test flight will fly soon. She said engineers still need to examine data to confirm none of the problems from Starship's previous flight recurred on this launch but added that \"all evidence points to a new failure mode\" on Tuesday's test flight.SpaceX will also study what caused the Super Heavy booster to explode on descent before moving forward with another booster catch attempt at Starbase, she said.\"Feeling both relieved and a bit disappointed,\" Diez wrote. \"Could have gone better today but also could have gone much worse.\"Stephen ClarkSpace ReporterStephen ClarkSpace ReporterStephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering private space companies and the world’s space agencies.

    "content": "Text settingsStory textSizeSmallStandardLargeWidth*StandardWideLinksStandardOrange* Subscribers onlyLearn moreMinimize to navOn Tuesday afternoon, just a few hours before a launch attempt of the ninth flight test of SpaceX's Starship vehicle, Elon Musk spoke with Ars Technica Senior Space Editor Eric Berger to talk about where his space company goes from here.In recent weeks, Musk has dialed back his focus on politics and said he wants to devote the majority of his time to SpaceX and his other companies. So what does that mean?The conversation came just ahead of the opening of Starship's launch window, at 6:30 pm CT (23:30 UTC) in South Texas. Here is a lightly edited transcript of the interview.Ars Technica:So what does success look like for you with today's launch?Elon Musk: These launches are all about data. The most important thing is data on how to improve the tile design, so it's basically data during the high heating, re-entry phase in order to improve the tiles for the next iteration. So we've got like a dozen or more tile experiments. We're trying different coatings on tiles. We're trying different fabrication techniques, different attachment techniques. We're varying the gap filler for the tiles. And also, we want to make sure that we've solved the issues that caused the explosions in the last two flights in the upper stage engine bay.Ars:Do you feel like you've solved that?Musk: I feel like we've got an 80 to—I don't want to tempt fate, I was going to say 90—but we've got about an 80 percent chance of having solved those issues. To really have a 100 percent chance, it requires the design iteration on the engine. And part of it was that we had to discover that we needed to tighten the bolts that attached the thrust chamber to the injector head after firing. So after the first firing, it turns out that's what caused some of the bolts to loosen a little bit; like some of them, some of the time, would loosen and that would allow basically fuel and gas to combine. Because the seal that normally blocks the passage of the fuel and oxidizer would gap a little bit, and it only takes a tiny amount of fuel and oxygen combining in a bad spot to explode the engine.Ars:You mentioned the tiles. Is upper-stage reentry the biggest technical problem standing in the way of getting to a fully, rapidly reusable Starship?Musk: Yeah. I mean, we've proven booster re-flight many times. Now this is a more efficient re-flight of booster, because the booster is literally coming back, getting caught by the tower, and being placed on the launch stand. That is much more efficient than landing on a droneship with legs, and then the ship's got to come back into port. That takes several days, and there are dozens of small things about Falcon 9 that need to be refurbished between flights. It's a pretty quick refurbishment, but it takes a few days, whereas Starship booster is designed for immediate re-flight. So it literally comes back, and in principle, less than 10 minutes later, you can be refilling propellant on the booster.Ars:You mentioned upgraded engines solving the problem with Starship's upper stage. What's the timeline on flying Raptor 3 engines?Musk: That's end of the year. The upgraded Raptors have a complete redesign of the aft end of the booster and the ship. So, because we don't need the heat shield around the upper portion of the engine, it greatly simplifies the base of the booster and the ship. It'll look a little, frankly, naked, especially on the booster side, because the engines will just be there, like, not with stuff around them. If you look at the current design, you can see the nozzles, but you can't see the thrust chamber and the turbopump, because each one of those are in basically an individually fire-walled cell. But Raptor 3 is designed to not require a heat shield around the thrust chamber and turbopump. And that's part of what makes it so clean. And this is a design change that I really had to push the team very hard to do, to get rid of any secondary structure, and any parts that could get burned off because there will be no heat shield. So it'll be very clear when we have a Raptor 3. Version 3 of the Ship and Booster has quite a radical redesign.Ars:Ten years ago you kind of made big bets on Starship and Starlink, and most people probably expected one or both of them to fail.Musk: Including me.Ars:Yeah. These were huge bets.Musk: I was interviewed in the early days of Starlink, and they were asking me what's the goal of Starlink? I said goal number one: don't go bankrupt, as every other [low-Earth orbit] communications constellation has gone bankrupt, and we don't want to join them in the cemetery. So any outcome that does not result in death would be a good outcome.Ars:Starlink has become really successful. It helped me during a hurricane. And Starship is coming along. As you look out for the next 10 years, what are you betting on big now that will really bear fruit for SpaceX a decade from now?Musk: Well, by far the biggest thing is Starship. If the Starship program is successful—and we see a path to success—it's just a question of when we will have created the first fully reusable orbital launch vehicle, which is the holy grail of rocketry, as you know. So no one has ever made a fully reusable orbital vehicle, and even the parts that have been reusable have been extremely arduous to reuse, such that the economics actually were worse than an expendable rocket in a lot of cases. The canonical example being the shuttle, where the shuttle's fully loaded, cost of the whole program, I believe, was about a billion dollars a flight.Ars:I sawone research paperthat estimated the fully loaded cost was about $1.5 billion.Musk. Yeah. And that is roughly equivalent to a Saturn V cost. But the Saturn V as an expendable rocket had four times the payload capacity of the shuttle. So the shuttle was like the principle of reusability was a good one, but the execution, unfortunately, was not. The shuttle got burdened by so many crazy requirements. You know, I've got this five-step first principles process thing for making things better. And step one of my five-step process is make the requirements less dumb. And for the government, it's the opposite. The government is making requirements more dumb.Ars:So getting a rapid and reusable Starship is the main goal for SpaceX over the next 5 to 10 years?Musk: Yeah, absolutely.Ars:You've been in the space industry now for almost 25 years. And in that time, SpaceX has gone a long way toward solving launch. So if you were coming into the industry today as a 20-something, you know, with a couple $100 million, what would be the problem you would want to solve? What should new companies, philanthropists, and others be working on in space?Musk: We're building the equivalent of the Union Pacific Railroad and the train. So once you have the transportation system to Mars, then there's a vast set of opportunities that open up to do anything on the surface of Mars, which includes, you know, doing everything from building a semiconductor fab to a pizza joint, basically building a civilization. So we want to solve the transport problem, and that can enable philanthropists and entrepreneurs to do things on Mars, which is everything needed for civilization. Look at, say, California. There were very few people in California until the Union Pacific was completed, and then California became the most populous state in the nation. And look at Silicon Valley and Hollywood and everything. So that's our goal. We want to get people there, and if we can get people there, then there's a literal world of opportunity.Ars:NASA is focused on Artemis and going back to the Moon. I think you have mixed feelings, perhaps, about that program.Musk: Yeah, I think its ambitions are too low.Ars:So does it matter to you if China gets back to the Moon before the United States? Do you care about that?Musk: I think the United States should be aiming for Mars, because we've already actually been to the Moon several times. Yeah, if China sort of equals that, I'm like, okay, sure, but that's something that America did 56 years ago. If you look at the Apollo program, when JFK gave that famous speech, it was about setting a target that's far in excess of what had been done. It wasn't, like, let's do what the Russians already did.Ars:Right. JFK wanted to accomplish something far beyond what the Soviets did.Musk: We should be going 1,000 times farther, and going to Mars. Mars is 1,000 times farther than the Moon. And if we are gonna go to the Moon, I think we should do a Moon base, or something that's the next level beyond Apollo.Ars:You've you spent the last year pretty heavily focused on politics. I'm wondering if you feel like that has slowed SpaceX down or harmed SpaceX?Musk: I think I probably did spend a bit too much time on politics, it's less than people would think, because the media is going to over-represent any political stuff, because political bones of contention get a lot of traction in the media. It's not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I've reduced that significantly in recent weeks.Eric BergerSenior Space EditorEric BergerSenior Space EditorEric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering everything from astronomy to private space to NASA policy, and author of two books:Liftoff, about the rise of SpaceX; andReentry, on the development of the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon.

Willison examined both the published prompts and leaked internal tool instructions to reveal what he calls \"a sort of unofficial manual for how best to use these tools.\"To understand what Willison is talking about, we'll need to explain what system prompts are. Large language models (LLMs) like the AI models that run Claude and ChatGPT process an input called a \"prompt\" and return an output that is the most likely continuation of that prompt. System prompts are instructions that AI companies feed to the models before each conversation to establish how they should respond.Unlike the messages users see from the chatbot, system prompts typically remain hidden from the user and tell the model its identity, behavioral guidelines, and specific rules to follow. Each time a user sends a message, the AI model receives the full conversation history along with the system prompt, allowing it to maintain context while following its instructions.A diagram showing how GPT conversational language model prompting works. It's slightly old, but it still applies. Just imagine the system prompt being the first message in this conversation.Credit: Benj Edwards / Ars TechnicaWhile Anthropicpublishesportions of its system prompts in its release notes, Willison's analysis reveals these published versions are incomplete. The full system prompts, which include detailed instructions for tools like web search and code generation, must be extracted through techniques like prompt injection—methods that trick the model into revealing its hidden instructions. Willison relied on leaked prompts gathered by researchers who used such techniques to obtain the complete picture of how Claude 4 operates.For example, even though LLMs aren't people, they can reproduce human-like outputs due to their training data that includes many examples of emotional interactions. Willison shows that Anthropic includes instructions for the models to provide emotional support while avoiding encouragement for self-destructive behavior. Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 receive identical instructions to \"care about people's wellbeing and avoid encouraging or facilitating self-destructive behaviors such as addiction, disordered or unhealthy approaches to eating or exercise.\"Willison, whocoinedthe term \"prompt injection\" in 2022, is always on the lookout for LLM vulnerabilities. In his post, he notes that reading system prompts reminds him of warning signs in the real world that hint at past problems. \"A system prompt can often be interpreted as a detailed list of all of the things the model used to do before it was told not to do them,\" he writes.Fighting the flattery problemCredit:alashi via Getty ImagesWillison's analysis comes as AI companies grapple with sycophantic behavior in their models. As wereportedin April, ChatGPT users have complained about GPT-4o's \"relentlessly positive tone\" and excessive flattery since OpenAI's March update. Users described feeling \"buttered up\" by responses like \"Good question! You're very astute to ask that,\" with software engineer Craig Weiss tweeting that \"ChatGPT is suddenly the biggest suckup I've ever met.\"The issue stems from how companies collect user feedback during training—people tend to prefer responses that make them feel good, creating a feedback loop where models learn that enthusiasm leads to higher ratings from humans. As a response to the feedback, OpenAI later rolled back ChatGPT's 4o model and altered the system prompt as well, somethingwe reported onand Willisonalso analyzedat the time.One of Willison's most interesting findings about Claude 4 relates to how Anthropic has guided both Claude models to avoid sycophantic behavior. \"Claude never starts its response by saying a question or idea or observation was good, great, fascinating, profound, excellent, or any other positive adjective,\" Anthropic writes in the prompt. \"It skips the flattery and responds directly.\"Other system prompt highlightsThe Claude 4 system prompt also includes extensive instructions on when Claude should or shouldn't use bullet points and lists, with multiple paragraphs dedicated to discouraging frequent list-making in casual conversation. \"Claude should not use bullet points or numbered lists for reports, documents, explanations, or unless the user explicitly asks for a list or ranking,\" the prompt states.Willison discovered discrepancies in Claude's stated knowledge cutoff date, noting that while Anthropic's comparison table lists March 2025 as the training data cutoff, the system prompt states January 2025 as the model's \"reliable knowledge cutoff date.\" He speculates this might help avoid situations where Claude confidently answers questions based on incomplete information from later months.An image of a boy amazed by flying letters.Credit:Getty ImagesWillison also emphasizes the extensive copyright \"protections\" built into Claude's search capabilities. Both models receive repeated instructions to use only one short quote (under 15 words) from web sources per response and to avoid creating what the prompt calls \"displacive summaries.\" The instructions specify that Claude should use only one short quote per response and explicitly refuse requests to reproduce song lyrics \"in ANY form.\"Thefull postincludes more analysis. Willison concludes that these system prompts serve as valuable documentation for understanding how to maximize these tools' capabilities. \"If you're an LLM power-user, the above system prompts are solid gold for figuring out how to best take advantage of these tools,\" he writes.Willison also calls on Anthropic and others to be more transparent about their system prompts, beyond publishing excerpts as Anthropic currently does: \"I wish Anthropic would take the next step and officially publish the prompts for their tools to accompany their open system prompts,\" he writes. \"I’d love to see other vendors follow the same path as well.\"Benj EdwardsSenior AI ReporterBenj EdwardsSenior AI ReporterBenj Edwards is Ars Technica's Senior AI Reporter and founder of the site's dedicated AI beat in 2022.

    "content": "Text settingsStory textSizeSmallStandardLargeWidth*StandardWideLinksStandardOrange* Subscribers onlyLearn moreMinimize to navCurrently, there are no nuclear power plants scheduled for construction in the US. Everybody with plans to build one hasn't had a reactor design approved, while nobody is planning to use any of the approved designs. This follows a period in which only three new reactors have entered service since 1990. Despite its extremely low carbon footprint, nuclear power appears to be dead in the water.On Friday, the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders intended to revive the US nuclear industry. These include plans to streamline the reactor approval process and boost the construction of experimental reactors by the Department of Energy. But they also contain language that's inconsistent with other administration priorities and fundamentally misunderstands the use of nuclear power. Plus, some timelines might be, shall we say, unrealistic: three new experimental reactors reaching criticality in just over a year.Slow nukesThe heyday of nuclear plant construction in the US was in the 1970s and 80s. But the 1979partial meltdownat the Three Mile Island plant soured public sentiment toward nuclear power. This also came at a time when nuclear plants typically generatedonly half of their rated capacity, making them an expensive long-term bet. As a result, plans for many plants, including some that were partially constructed, were canceled.In this century, only four new reactors on existing plant sites have started construction, and two of those have since been cancelled due to delays and spiralling costs. The two reactors that have entered service also suffered considerable delays and cost overruns.While safety regulations are often blamed for the construction costs,researchers who studied construction recordsfound that many delays simply arose from workers being idled while they awaited equipment or the completion of other work on the site. This may indicate that the lack of a well-developed supply chain for reactor parts is a significant contributor. And the last major changes in safety regulations came in response to theFukushima meltdown and explosions, which identified key vulnerabilities in traditional designs.A large number of startups have proposed designs that should be far less prone to failure. Many of these are SMRs, or small modular reactors, which promise economies of scale by building the reactor at a central facility and then shipping it to the site of installation. But, as of yet, only a single reactor of this type has been approved in the US, and the only planned installation of that designwas canceledas the projected cost of its electricity became uncompetitive.That environment makes investing in nuclear power extremely risky on its own. However, we're also at a time when the prices of natural gas, wind, and especially solar are incredibly low, making it challenging to justify the large up-front costs of nuclear power, along with the long lead time before it starts generating returns on those costs.A new hope?That's the situation the Trump administration hopes to change, though you can question the sincerity of that effort. To start, the executive orders were issued on the Friday before a holiday weekend, typically the time reserved for news that you hope nobody pays attention to. One of the announcements also refers to nuclear power as dispatchable (meaning it can be ramped up and down quickly), which it most certainly isn't. Finally, it touts nuclear power as avoiding the risks associated with other forms of power, \"such as pollution with potentially deleterious health effects.\" Elsewhere, however, the administration is eliminating pollution regulations and promoting the use of high-pollution fuels, such as coal.Overall, the actions proposed in the new executive orders range from the fanciful to the potentially reasonable. For example, the \"Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base\" order calls for the development of the capacity to reprocess spent nuclear fuel to obtain useful fuel from it, a process that's extremely expensive compared to simply mining new fuel, and would only make nuclear power less economically viable. It also calls for recommendations regarding permanent storage of any remaining waste, an issue that has remained unresolved for decades.Mixed in with that are more sensible recommendations about ensuring the capacity to enrich isotopes to the purities needed to fuel power plants.The order also calls for the Department of Energy (DOE) to provide financial support for the industry to boost construction of new plants, something the agency already does through a loan guarantee program. Even though those guarantees have not resulted in new construction plans in over a decade, the EO calls for the effort to result in \"10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030.\" While the Biden administration had approved payments to keep nuclear plants open, Trump is calling for funding to be used to reopen some plants that had been unable to operate economically—something that has not been done in the US previously. It also calls for money to go to restart construction at sites where reactors were canceled, although only two of those are less than decades old.Similar unrealistic time scales are present in the \"Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies\" order. This is intended to encourage some of the proposed designs for SMRs and inherently safe reactors that are currently on the drawing board. It directs the Army to install one of these at a military base that will be operating within the next three years. And it directs the secretary of energy to contract with companies to build three test reactors that will sustain a nuclear reaction by July 4, 2026.The accelerated schedule is expected to come from enabling the secretary of energy to simply ignore any aspect of the environmental review that the companies building the reactor complain about: \"The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, use all available authorities to eliminate or expedite the Department’s environmental reviews for authorizations, permits, approvals, leases, and any other activity requested by an applicant or potential applicant.\"Regulatory reformThe other big executive order targets theNuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC), which approves license designs. The order blames this on how the NRC is structured: \"The NRC charges applicants by the hour to process license applications, with prolonged timelines that maximize fees while throttling nuclear power development.\"It also criticizes the commission's regulations as being based on the idea that there is no safe level of exposure to radiation, though it provides no evidence that the idea is wrong. This is said to result in regulations that attempt to lower exposures below those caused by a natural environment.The order attempts to accelerate the approval process enough to ensure that the US goes from 100 GW of generating capacity to 400 GW by 2050. This is largely done by setting hard time limits on the approval process through consultations with DOGE, including a limit of 18 months for approval of new nuclear plants. It also calls for the adoption of \"science-based radiation limits,\" claiming that flaws with existing limits had been discussed earlier—even though the earlier discussion made no mention of scientific flaws.In keeping with plans for mass production of modular reactors, the order also calls for a single certification process for these designs, focusing solely on site differences once the general reactor design is accepted as safe.Overall, there are some reasonable ideas scattered throughout the executive orders (though whether their implementation ends up being reasonable is questionable, especially given DOGE's involvement). But the majority of them are based on the idea that regulation is the primary reason for nuclear energy's atrophy in the US.The reality is that an underdeveloped supply chain and unfavorable economics are far larger factors. It's difficult to justify investing in a plant that might take a decade to start selling power when the up-front costs of solar are far smaller, and it can start producing power while still under construction. The most likely way to see a nuclear resurgence in the US is for the government to pay for the plants itself. There's a small bit of that here, in the call for the DOE to fund the construction of experimental reactors at third-party sites. But it's not enough to significantly shift the trajectory of US nuclear power.John TimmerSenior Science EditorJohn TimmerSenior Science EditorJohn is Ars Technica's science editor.

NPR said Trump acted illegally, and that losing federal funding could force it to shut newsrooms and dramatically scale back news coverage.On May 1, Trump issued anexecutive ordertitled, \"Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,\" in which he ordered the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and all US agencies to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS. The White House had previouslyallegedthat NPR and PBS \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"NPR'slawsuitin US District Court for the District of Columbia asked the court to declare Trump's executive order and all actions to implement it unconstitutional. NPR's lawsuit said that Trump \"has no authority under the Constitution to take such action. On the contrary, the power of the purse is reserved to Congress, and the President has no inherent authority to override Congress's will on domestic spending decisions. By unilaterally imposing restrictions and conditions on funds in contravention of Congress, the Order violates the Separation of Powers and the Spending Clause of the Constitution.\"Trump violated the First Amendment, the lawsuit said. \"The Order is textbook retaliation and viewpoint-based discrimination in violation of the First Amendment, and it interferes with NPR's and the Local Member Stations' freedom of expressive association and editorial discretion,\" NPR wrote.\"By basing its directives on the content and perceived viewpoints expressed in NPR's programming, the Order puts NPR on notice that, if it is ever to receive federal funding again, it must adapt its journalistic and editorial choices to suit the government's preferences,\" the lawsuit also said.Stations join NPR in lawsuitNPR was joined in the lawsuit by three Colorado-based stations that receive federal funding. Trump's executive order said that public radio and television stations may not use federal funds to buy NPR and PBS programming.Besides Trump, the defendants named in the lawsuit include the Office of Management and Budget, the Treasury Department, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and the CPB. The lawsuit seeks orders preventing the NEA and CPB from withholding funding based on the executive order.NPR and the local stations \"bring this action to challenge an Executive Order that violates the expressed will of Congress and the First Amendment's bedrock guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association, and also threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information,\" the lawsuit said.Congress appropriated $535 million in general funding for the CPB in fiscal years 2025, 2026, and 2027, the lawsuit said. \"NPR is funded primarily through sponsorships, donations from individuals and private entities, membership and licensing fees from local public radio stations, direct funding from the Corporation, and direct funding from other government grants, including grants awarded by the NEA,\" the lawsuit said.NPR: Funding loss “would be catastrophic”NPR said the loss of federal funding and fees from stations that would otherwise acquire programming from NPR \"would be catastrophic\" to the organization. NPR receives about 31 percent of its operating revenue through membership fees and licensing fees from local stations \"and additional millions of dollars from CPB to support NPR's coverage of particular issue areas, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine,\" the lawsuit said.The loss of funding could force NPR \"to shutter or downsize collaborative newsrooms and rural reporting initiatives,\" and \"eliminate or scale back critical national and international coverage that serves the entire public radio system and is not replicable at scale on the local level,\" the lawsuit said.The NEA terminated a grant award to NPR one day after Trump's executive order, the lawsuit said. \"This termination confirms that NEA is complying with the Order and has rendered NPR ineligible to apply for grants going forward,\" the lawsuit said.One legal problem with the executive order, according to NPR, is that it \"purports to require the Corporation to prohibit local stations from using CPB grants to acquire NPR's programming, notwithstanding a statutory requirement that stations must use 'restricted' funds to acquire or produce programming that is distributed nationally and serves the needs of national audiences.\"Local stations would be forced \"to redirect those funds to acquire different national programming—in contravention of their own editorial choices—and to take additional, non-federal funds out of their budgets to continue acquiring NPR's programming,\" the lawsuit said.Jon BrodkinSenior IT ReporterJon BrodkinSenior IT ReporterJon is a Senior IT Reporter for Ars Technica.

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.Elon Musk’s official role within the United States government is coming to an end. The billionaire Tesla CEO announced his White House departurein an X post on Wednesday night, thanking President Donald Trump for the opportunity to “reduce wasteful spending” by leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).“The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,” Musk wrote, saying that his position as a special government employee was coming “to an end.”Musk’s departure was expected. He hadannounced plans earlier this monthto step away from government and spend “a lot less” on US political campaigns, having invested nearly $300 million into Trump’s Presidential run. He’s also pledged to spend more time on Tesla, with his controversial political stinthaving likely contributedto the EV maker’sspiralling sales. The role of special government employee also comes with a 130-day time limit — a deadline that was fast approaching if DOGE’s establishment on January 20th is considered Musk’s start date.A White House officialtoldReutersthat Musk was being off-boarded on Wednesday night. The publication reports that Musk didn’t formally discuss his departure with Trump before announcing it on X, and that his exit was decided “at a senior staff level.”Musk is parting ways with the Trump administration a day after criticizing the President’s “One Big Beautiful Bill”in an interview with CBS, saying the landmark tax legislation would increase the federal deficit and undermine his cost-cutting efforts at DOGE. During Trump’s campaign, Musk initially pledged that DOGE would cut at least $2 trillion in federal spending before later slashing its targets to $1 trillion and then $150 billion. TheDOGE websitecurrently claims to have saved $175 billion, but that figure should be taken with a fistful of saltgiven previous exaggerations.See More:Elon MuskNewsPolicyPoliticsTechMost PopularMost PopularApple is reportedly going to rename all of its operating systemsTesla continues to circle the drainUS will ban foreign officials to punish countries for social media rulesThe plan for nationwide fiber internet might be upended for StarlinkSamsung’s One UI 8 beta arrives on Galaxy S25 phonesInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native ad",

The updates allow you to keep HDR disabled across the whole of Windows, but still stream HDR video in all its glory, alongside more control over Dolby Vision.The latestKB5058499 updateis available to all Windows 11 users right now if you’ve enabled the “get the latest updates as soon as they’re available” option in Windows Update. Once it’s installed, you can now toggle the ability to stream HDR video option even when HDR is disabled in Windows, allowing you to view HDR content from apps like Netflix or websites like YouTube without having to enable HDR throughout Windows.Microsoft is also updating Windows 11’s HDR support to allow you to independently toggle Dolby Vision support in content or throughout Windows. Dolby Vision used to be forced on inside Windows if you enabled it on your monitor, so it’s nice to have the option to be able to toggle it on or off.These new options are great for people who simply disable HDR in Windows because of its patchy support. I personally disable HDR in Windows and use the keyboard shortcut (Windows Key + Alt + B) to enable it in games that properly support it, simply because I rely on a variety of content capture tools for screenshots and screen recording that produce a washed out image because they don’t properly support HDR or provide a way to capture individual SDR content.While HDR support in Windows has improved over the past year thanks to the latest batch of OLED monitors, I’d still like to see game developers and Microsoft take HDR more seriously.Auto HDR is great for games, but it’s still a really fiddly and manual process to get HDR to work well across a variety of apps and games in Windows.See More:MicrosoftNewsTechWindowsMost PopularMost PopularApple is reportedly going to rename all of its operating systemsTesla continues to circle the drainUS will ban foreign officials to punish countries for social media rulesThe plan for nationwide fiber internet might be upended for StarlinkSamsung’s One UI 8 beta arrives on Galaxy S25 phonesInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native ad",

Most of us probably won’t be able to afford the helpful sentient humanoids being developed in our lifetimes, but robot vacuums are an affordable way to experience that promised utopia right now.RelatedThe best robot vacuums you can buyThe best budget robot vacuumsThe best robot vacuum and mop to buy right nowToday’s floor cleaners are also more advanced than ever. In addition to vacuuming, many of the best models can now mop, allowing you to tackle both carpet and hardwood flooring. Some can automatically dispense of their trash and dirty water, too, and clean their own components without intervention. Soon, we’ll even have models that canpick up dirty laundryandpurify the airin your home, preventing you from having to lift a finger.But if you need something relatively affordable for daily cleaning, you’d be surprised how little you have to pay for premium features. Below, we’ve listed the best deals currently available on a slate ofVerge-approved robot vacuums, whether you prefer a budget entry-level model from Yeedi or a top-of-the-line offering from iRobot, Dreame, and more.The best Roborock dealsRoborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra— our pick for the best robot vacuum overall — is available fromBest Buy,Roborock, andAmazonfor $1,299.99 ($500 off), which is $200 shy of its best price to date. The combination of a 10,000Pa suction power and dual rubber roller brushes makes it a terrific vacuum, one that can easily pick up pet hair and other debris. It can also mop with great efficiency thanks to a sonic mopping system that vibrates the mop pad 4,000 times a minute, allowing it to clean sticky juices, thick condiments, and other common spills. The mop arm can extend to cover corners and baseboard edges, too.The S8 MaxV Ultra’s camera-equipped AI obstacle avoidance makes it the best navigator in Roborock’s lineup and one of the top models overall, though it’s not quite as strong as Roomba’s. The mobile app offers ample options to customize cleaning zones and schedules, and you can use its dedicated voice assistant to start and stop routines. It’s also a Matter-ready robot that’s compatible with Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home.Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra$1300$180028% off$1300With top-notch vacuuming performance, an easy-to-use app, and built-in voice control, the S8 MaxV Ultra is a superb vacuum and good mop. It features Roborock’s best obstacle detection, innovative features like dirt detection, and a hands-free dock that makes it an expensive but excellent choice.Read More$1300 at Amazon$1300 at Best Buy$1300 at RoborockThe best Dreame dealsTheDreame X40 Ultrais another mopping robot, and while it’s on the more expensive side, you can currently pick it up for $899.99 ($600 off) directly fromDreame, which matches its all-time low. You’re paying a premium for 12,000Pa of suction power and a pair of removable, self-retracting mop pads, which it can automatically clean and dry on its own using the included base. It can also empty its own bin and refill its own water tank.RelatediRobot’s latest Roomba robot vacuum is great news for pet ownersThis Dreame robot vacuum has legsThe Dreame X40 Ultra features an extendable side brush and mop pads, too, offering better coverage for baseboards, corners, and the underside of your furniture. It uses a combination of AI-powered cameras and “3D-structured light” (presumably based on lidar technology) to map and navigate rooms, with customizable keep-out zones and more functions available in the app. There’s also a dirt detection system that can identify messier spills and adjust its cleaning routine accordingly.Dreame X40 Ultra$900$150040% off$900With a unique ability to remove and reattach its mop pads, the Dreame X40 solves the problem of vacuuming carpets (with 12,000Pa suction power) while also mopping hard floors. Its mops can also swing out and under low furniture, getting where most bots can’t reach.Read More$900 at Dreame$1000 at Amazon (Prime members)TheDreame L20 Ultrais available for $599.99 ($400 off) fromAmazon(for Prime members) andDreame, which is $50 shy of its best price to date. The L20 Ultra is an excellent alternative to Dreame’s newer flagship robots, including the X40. It lacks a bit of power in comparison, though its 7,000Pa of suction power is still enough for most cleaning jobs. It also doesn’t have the L40’s tri-cut brush, which makes the step-up model more efficient at picking up pet hair. The only other real advantage the X40 holds over the L20 is its self-extending arms for vacuuming (though the dual mop pads can extend a bit for baseboard and corner coverage), nor does it have dirt detection.The L20 Ultra’s base station is rather large, but it can take care of the entire cleaning process, including emptying the dustbin, emptying and refilling the water tanks, and washing and drying the mop pads. It doesn’t have a heated cleaning function for the mop pads, however. It uses a lidar-based AI-powered navigation system, and you can prompt it to start cleaning by voice using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.Dreame L20 Ultra$600$100040% off$600The L20 Ultra is a great all-around bot that can remove its mop pads to vacuum carpet and do the splits with its mops to better clean your baseboards. It has 7,000Pa suction, a bigger base station, and fewer advanced cleaning features than the newer X30 and X40 Ultra models, but it’s still an excellent robot vacuum.Read More$600 at Amazon$600 at DreameThe best SwitchBot dealsTheSwitchBot S10is available fromAmazonfor an all-time low price of $390.99 at checkout, down from $1,199. The S10 is one of the most affordable robot vacuum / mop hybrids you can buy, one that can refill its own tank so long as you hook the battery-powered base station into your home’s plumbing. It can also dry its own mop pads and empty its own bin at a separate docking bay, and offers enough capacity to run for up to 90 days without intervention.RelatediRobot launches eight new Roombas and finally adds lidar mappingRobot vacuums from iRobot, Roborock, and Ecovacs getting upgraded support for Apple HomeThe S10’s self-cleaning roller mop is more effective than the typical pads we see in most other units, but it’s also limited to a smaller coverage area. It only has a single roller brush for vacuuming, but its respectable 6,500Pa suction can make up for it. And while it has lidar mapping and AI-powered obstacle avoidance, we found it still has a tendency to get stuck on laundry, bath mats, and other obstacles. The S10 is also one of the fewrobovacs with Matter support, however, which effectively enables native control through Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa (though said platforms don’t yet fully support robot vacuums).Read our SwitchBot S10 review.SwitchBot S10$391$119967% off$391The S10 is a great mopping robot with a battery-powered water refill dock that makes it the most hands-free robovac we’ve tested. A separate auto-empty dock takes care of the dust. It’s big and loud and lacks some features found on high-end robots, but it does a great job of keeping your floors clean.Read More$391 at Amazon (at checkout)$460 at SwitchBot (with code MDYLOM)TheSwitchBot K10 Plusis available for around $240 ($260 off) fromAmazonandSwitchBot(with promo codeFGFG50), which is an all-time low.At 3.6 inches high and 9.8 inches wide, it’s a more petite option if you want something that can maneuver tighter spaces, which it does to decent success with a lidar-based mapping system that supports digital keep-out zones. It only has 2,500Pa suction, but that should be powerful enough to lift dirt in all but the deepest carpeting. You can also attach disposable mopping pads, though their mopping function doesn’t work well. The K10 Plus comes with a self-emptying dock that can hold a respectable four liters of dirt before it needs emptying.SwitchBot K10 Plus$240$40040% off$240The smallest robot vac on the block, the K10 Plus, doesn’t compare to the other bots here in terms of performance, but if you have a small space where other vacs can’t get to, it’s better than nothing. It’s also very quiet, making it ideal for small spaces like home offices and bedrooms or a very small studio apartment.Read More$240 at Amazon$240 at SwitchBot (with code FGFG50)The best Eufy dealsTheEufy X10 Pro Omni, our current pick for the best midrange robot vacuum / mop, is now available atAmazonandBest Buyfor $699.99 ($100 off), which is about $150 shy of its all-time low. You can also grab itdirectly from Eufyfor the same price when you use promo codeWS24T2351121at checkout.The X10 Pro Omni is a bit of a novelty, at least in comparison to other robovacs in its price range, in that it offers AI-powered obstacle detection, which allows it to deftly navigate cables and other clutter. It also features a slew of functions you’d expect from top-of-the-line models, including 8,000Pa of suction power, speedy lidar-powered mapping, and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping.Mind you, none of these features are as effective as they are on more premium models, though the result is an all-in-one bot that punches above its weight. Plus, it has heated mop drying and onboard water reservoir, the latter of which prevents it from having to return to its multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill docktoofrequently.Eufy X10 Pro Omni$700$80013% off$700The X10 is a great robovac with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, powerful oscillating mops, a user-friendly app, and good mapping capabilities.Read More$700 at Amazon$700 at Eufy (with code WS24T2351121)$700 at Best BuyIf you’re looking for a bump-and-roll model that’s relatively budget-friendly,the discontinuedEufy 11S Maxis on sale atAmazonfor just $179.99 ($70 off). The 11S Max stands out from other robovacs because it doesn’t use Wi-Fi, meaning it doesn’t require you to fiddle with a mobile app on your phone. Instead, you can control it using an on-board button or with the included remote, which also allows you to create cleaning schedules. It’s relatively quiet and reliable, too, with 2,000Pa of suction power and replaceable parts, making it a great long-term investment for those who want something basic.Eufy 11S Max$180$28036% off$180The Eufy 11S Max is a super slim, repairable bump-and-roll bot with a large 600ml bin and three cleaning levels. Its biggest selling point, however, is that it lacks Wi-Fi, meaning you don’t have to fiddle with an app.Read More$180 at AmazonThe best Yeedi dealsTheYeedi Cubeis currently down to an all-time low of $246.99 ($243 off) atAmazonfor Prime members. It’s not easy to find a self-emptying / self-cleaning vacuum at this price, as those features are typically only available on robots that cost upward of $600 or more.With 5,100Pa of suction power, the Cube can tackle most common vacuuming scenarios, though its single hybrid rubber / bristle brush can get easily tangled with pet hair. It mops better than most models in its range, however, namely because its vibrating microfiber pads can actually scrub your floors. The Cube uses lasers for object avoidance, too, though it’s not as effective for navigation as those with lidar and AI smarts. It can avoid large furniture and other objects, but it might need your help rerouting around cables, toys, and laundry. Still, we found it navigates better than most other robots under $300.Yeedi Cube$247$47047% off$247One of the first robots that can vacuum, mop, self-empty, self-wash, and self-dry with hot air for under $1,000, the Yeedi Cube is an older model that currently retails for under $500. It’s a good vacuum and mop for hands-free cleaning on a budget.Read More$247 at Amazon (with Prime)The best Shark dealsTheShark Matrix Plus 2-in-1is a great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that’s now on sale for $399.99 ($320 off) atAmazon,Best Buy, anddirectly from Shark, which is $20 shy of its all-time low price. Before theEufy X10 Pro Omnitook its place, the Matrix Plus 2-in-1 was our runner-up pick for those seeking a midrange robot vacuum that mops and automatically empties its own bin. Its vibrating, sonic mopping feature does an excellent job of scrubbing hardwood floors; however, keep in mind that you’ll have to fill and attach the mop reservoir manually.Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop$400$70043% off$400The Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop mops very well — doing a swingy, scrubbing movement with its rear end when in “Matrix mode.” However, you have to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir and empty the bin when it mops, as it only self-empties in vacuum mode and can only avoid larger objects.Read More$400 at Amazon$400 at Best Buy$400 at SharkRelatedI put four robot lawnmowers through a brutal backyard summer showdown — only one person got injuredThe latest Ecovacs vacuum sounds like a blastTheShark Ionis a a solid bump-and-roll bot that’s currently on sale for $179.99 ($70 off) atAmazon, which is one of its better prices to date. It does a good job of picking up dirt and debris, and with a 120-minute runtime, it won’t run out of juice as quickly as other models in its price range. Its hybrid roller brush, which combines bristle and plastic, also helps reduce unwanted tangling, which happens more frequently with standard bristle brushes. While the Ion doesn’t come with advanced features like mapping, it’s another good option if you’re looking for a no-frills robovac that’ll get the job done on a shoestring budget.Shark Ion$250$230-9% off$250A truly basic budget bot, the Shark has good suction power, a big bin, and a roller brush made of bristle and plastic that doesn’t get tangled up easily. There’s no mapping, keep out zones, or obstacle detection, but the bot does offer big wheels that easily roll over obstacles and high transitions between rooms. It’s easy to buy replacement parts, too, making this one that can go for years.Read More$250 at Amazon$250 at SharkThe best Roomba dealsYou can getiRobot’s Roomba Combo 10 MaxfromAmazon,Best Buy, andiRobotfor $799.99 ($600 off), which is its second-best price to date. We think it’s the best robot vacuum for pet hair, one that combines high suction power with rotating dual rubber brushes that pick up without getting tangled. What’s even more impressive is that it comes with a new multifunction charging dock that allows it to empty its bin, wash its own mop, and even refill its mopping tank. Add in Matter support, excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, and a retractable mop arm, and you’ve got a robovac that makes cleaning almost entirely hands-free.Roomba Combo 10 Max$800$140043% off$800iRobot’s first mopping bot that can refill its water tank and wash and dry its mop, the Combo 10 Max, features a retractable mop arm and superior suction power. It’s also iRobot’s first robot to support Matter.Read More$800 at Amazon$800 at Best Buy$800 at iRobotIf you’re working with a tight budget, theCombo i5is also a good vacuum / mop — one you can pick up on sale atAmazonright now for $199.99, down from $349.99. It’s not as powerful as the aforementioned Combo 10 Max and can’t refill its water tank or wash and dry its own mop; however, it still features Roomba’s wide, dual rubber brushes, which do an excellent job of picking up dirt and debris. It doesn’t support virtual keep-out zones or Matter, either, though you can schedule it to clean specific rooms at set times. It’s also compatible with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and like all Roombas, it’s relatively easy to repair.iRobot Roomba Combo i5$200$35043% off$200The Roomba Combo i5 Plus is the company’s budget vacuum and mop robot with room mapping features but no virtual keep-out zones.Read More$200 at Amazon$280 at Best Buy$300 at Amazon (with self-emptying dock)The best Dyson dealsTheDyson 360 Vis Navis now available fromAmazon,Best Buy, andDysonfor around $799.95 ($200 off), which is its best price yet. The D-shaped robot vacuum is thebest option for carpets we’ve ever tested, one that can deliver an impressive 65 air watts of suction. Its huge roller brush can also reach into corners and along edges for a more thorough clean, and while it lacks an auto-empty dock like many of its competitors, its 500ml dustbin is large enough that you won’t need to constantly empty it. Unfortunately, you’ll have to compromise on more premium bells and whistles — including AI-powered obstacle avoidance — and its battery life is limited to 65 minutes per charge. But if you prioritize power above all, Dyson’s latest model is still worth considering.Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum$800$100020% off$800Dyson’s latest robovac is a great option for simple floor plans and carpets.

Previously a contributor to Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, and US News.Tile trackers are getting more deeply integrated with the Life360 app. In ablog post published this week, Life360 announced that you’ll now be able to set up and manage the handy Bluetooth location trackers without using the Tile app at all.Life360, a family safety and location app, purchased Tile’s Bluetooth device-tracking business for$205 million in 2022. Since then,Tiles have been part of the Life360 app, allowing you to track the location of both people and items in one app, but you still needed to use the Tile app to set up the tracking devices. As part of the transition, the Life360 app will get some of the Tile app’s features, including sending an automatic push notification if you leave an item behind and the ability to see location history for Tile-tracked items.RelatedTile owner Life360 picks satellites over partnering with Apple or GoogleLife360 confirms a hacker stole Tile tracker IDs and customer infoThe move seems aimed at pushing Tile’s users toward the Life360 app. The company toldTechCrunch that the Tile app is not being retired “at this time,”but that’s not surprising, as it’s likely to take a while to move customers to the new app. Considering that as of last month, theTile.com domain now redirects toLife360.com, the Tile app’s days feel numbered.As part of the update, Life360 is also reorganizing itspaid plans,adding theSOS Alerts featurethat lets youcall 911 by triple-tapping on a compatible Tileto its $7.99 a month Silver membership, along with seven days of location history. SOS Alerts were previously only available with the $14.99 a month Gold plan, which also allows for 30 days of location history. You can use Life360 for free to track both people and items, but you only see 2 days of location history.Life360 is a location app designed for families. Similar to Apple’s Find My app, it allows authorized members of a “Circle” to see each other’s real-time locations in the app. Each member has control over whether the app shares their location, as well as how precise a view of their location other members have at any time. The service can send alerts to members of your circle when you arrive somewhere, leave somewhere, and when your flight lands. It essentially does away with all those “text me when you get there” requests from parents and family members.Life360 offers more than just location services. It styles itself as an overall family safety app and has features such as crash detection and roadside assistance. Its paid plans also include driver reports, which show phone usage, top speed, and hard braking data. Families with teens who are tempted by this service may want to consider exactly how that data is shared before signing up for it.While Life360 says itno longer sells precise user data, its current privacy policy states it may share data with business partners, includingdriving analytics services. These services may share data with insurance companies, as detailed inthis report by Kashmir Hill in theNew York Times.See More:NewsTechMost PopularMost PopularApple is reportedly going to rename all of its operating systemsTesla continues to circle the drainUS will ban foreign officials to punish countries for social media rulesThe plan for nationwide fiber internet might be upended for StarlinkSamsung’s One UI 8 beta arrives on Galaxy S25 phonesInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native ad",

In Tesla’s case, it can keep you updated on the charging session and help alert you to move your car when it’s done to avoid idle fees.The Supercharger Live Activity shows how much time is left in the session, your current charge percentage, an estimated cost, the charge speed, and how much energy you’ve added. Currently, it does not show up if you’re charging at home or non-Supercharger stalls.Supercharger Live Activities is available now in the Tesla iOS app version 4.45.0 in the App Store. It’s the latest major feature addition to the app since Tesla enabledApple Watch digital key support last December.In addition to the iOS update, Tesla is also rolling out a new feature for some of its newer EVs that canalert owners if they’ve forgotten their kid in the car. The new “Child Left Alone” feature is only coming to Europe for now, specifically to the new Model 3 (mid-2023 and later), which includes in-cabin radar.

He joined in 2018, and served as commerce editor at Polygon until May 2025.If you, like me, have begun to pick out accessories for your Switch 2 before it arrives on June 5th, here’s a money-saving tip: a handful of Hori’s upcoming accessories are at least 30 percent off at Amazon. My favorite (and arguably the most stylish) among the bunch is the Puff Pouch carrying case. Its design evokes the look of a puffy jacket, if not quite to the level of premium puffiness ofApple’s zip-up case for the Vision Pro headset.The Puff Pouch zips open and shut, with a handle on one of its long sides. It boasts room for the console, up to six game cartridges, and extra accessories, like a small battery, the power brick, or a webcam. Even though there’s a Switch 2 logo patch embroidered into the pouch’s fabric, there’s nothing stopping you from using it with an original Switch instead. That’ll be our little secret. Originally priced at $44.99, this case is $29.99 atAmazonand comes out June 16th.Hori Puff Pouch for Switch 2 and Switch$30$4533% off$30$30 at AmazonFor an extra $5 (totaling to $34.99 atAmazon), you might prefer Hori’s Switch 2 crossbody shoulder bag. It offers a similar amount of storage capacity to the Puff Pouch, and can also be used to tote the Switch 2, or any of the original Switch models. As an alternative to wearing the bag, you can also carry it by hand with its strap. This one comes out June 30th.Hori Adventure Pack for Switch 2 and Switch$35$5030% off$35$35 at AmazonThe last (for now) discounted Hori product is its Dual USB PlayStand, a small USB hub that gives your console more ports for accessories, much like the TV dock does. It has two USB-A ports for controllers, plus a USB-C port in case you want to keep your Switch 2 charged as you play. Normally $69.99 (whew, that’s costly), it’s selling at a more reasonable (but still pretty steep) $39.99 atAmazon.

    "content": "Save this storySaveSave this storySaveSome species ofhummingbird are adapting to urban life by undergoing evolutionary changes in their anatomy, influenced by the proliferation of artificial drinking fountains. According to some biologists, this might show that these birds are on their way to becomingcommensalwith humans—benefiting from living closely alongside them—like pigeons have in urban areas.Arecent studyfound that the size and shape of the beaks of Anna’s hummingbirds (Calypte anna), a species native to North America, have changed. A hummingbird’s beak is naturally long and slender in order to access nectar located in deep inside flowers. However, in recent decades, the beaks of urban Anna’s hummingbirds have evolved to be significantly longer and larger to better access sugar-laced drinking fountains installed outside of homes, which have proliferated in urban areas. This adaptation suggests that these feeders offer hummingbirds more food than nectar-filled flowers.The study, which looked at reported sightings of the birds as well museum specimens from the past 160 years, also found that males are developing sharper, more pointed beaks, possibly to compete with other hummingbirds for access to these sugar-filled fountains.Populations of these hummingbirds expanded northward in California at the same time as the establishment of urban centers where feeding could take place. The researchers discovered that the population density ofCalypte annahas also increased over time, and found that this appears to be linked to the proliferation of feeding fountains and nectar-producing eucalyptus trees, both of which were introduced to the region by humans.These morphological changes to the hummingbirds have occurred rapidly. According to the study,Calypte annapopulations in 1930 were very different from those in 1950, when the birds’ bills had already begun to grow. In just 20 years, equivalent to about 10 generations of these birds, evolution left its mark, the authors note.To conduct the research, the team used sighting data for the species in all 58 Californian counties between 1938 and 2019, in addition to analyzing specimens preserved in museums. They also turned to old newspaper advertisements to estimate the number of feeders in use during the last century. Finally, they developed a computational model to predict hummingbird expansion, taking into account assisted feeding and the presence of eucalyptus trees.An Anna’s hummingbird in flight.Teresa Kopec/Getty Images“They seem to be moving where we are going and changing quite rapidly to succeed in their new environments. We can think of the Anna’s hummingbird as a commensal species, similar to pigeons,” says Nicolas Alexandre, coauthor of the study and a geneticist at Colossal Biosciences, a biotechnology andde-extinctioncompany based in Dallas, Texas.Hummingbird feeders or drinkers use sugar water to attract hummingbirds and provide food during seasons when flower nectar is scarce. According to the journalScience, one of the oldest records of these devices dates back to 1928, although they were probably in use much earlier. In general, they do not pose a risk to the species, as long as they are cleaned regularly to avoid the proliferation of bacteria and fungi that can affect hummingbirds.Another species of bird, the common pigeon (Columba livia) has also adapted to living in cities. Pigeons can be found in urban spaces around the world, taking advantage of the plentiful nesting sites and food that cities have to offer. They exist in urban environments without having a significant impact on human activities, this being a clear example of commensalism, where one species gains advantages by linking with another without directly harming it.Columba liviaoriginally inhabited rocky areas of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. However, it was domesticated more than 5,000 years ago as a source of food and due to its excellent sense of direction, which meant the birds could be used for carrying written messages. As a result, many were released into new habitats, with some choosing to live in cities, becoming part of the urban fauna. Today, they are one of the most common birds in the world.This story originally appeared onWIREDen Españoland has been translated from Spanish.",

Elon Musk has today officially stepped down from his government duties, afterscaling back his involvementearlier this month.Citing the end of his “scheduled time as a Special Government Employee” in a post onhis social media site X, Musk added: “The DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.”Courts are trying to strike down some of DOGE’s most egregious efforts. It may seem as though the worst excesses of DOGE have passed, replaced by something closer to a stasis.This isn’t true. Not even close.While the image of DOGE most likely burned into your retina is that of Elon Musk wielding a literal chain saw, the theatrics belie an organization that has quietly permeated all corners of the federal government. More than that, it’s increasingly clear that its objectives are now indistinguishable from that of the broader Trump administration. Removing DOGE at this point would be like trying to remove a drop of food coloring from a glass of water.And what is it doing from its perch? Not loudly, clumsily attempting to fire thousands of government employees, but working in secrecy to collect, combine, and analyze data that was never intended to comingle. Using that information tofind and surveil immigrants. Giving the Justice Departmentan assiston alleged voter fraud indictments.Musk has officially stepped down—though he met with House Republicans just last week—his lieutenants are still firmly in place at the agencies that control the federal workforce and regulate his companies. DOGE isreportedly usinghis xAI Grok chatbot to parse sensitive data, which potentially means millions of Americans’ personal information is doubling as training data for the model. A19-year-old who goes by Big Balls onlineis still a central figure.Meanwhile, the victories against DOGE may be short-lived. The Trump administration used it as a battering ram to push its policies through with overwhelming force. While the courts have held firm in some cases—just this week, a judge declaredDOGE’s takeover of the United States Institute of Peaceto be unlawful—the policies still exist, and there are other ways to achieve them. The Wall Street Journalreported recentlythat director of the White House Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought would pick up DOGE’s cost-cutting mantle in the post-Musk era. Expect him to wield not a hammer but a finely edged blade.This has always been the plan. Vought is the architect of Project 2025, the policy road map that DOGE has been following turn by turn. He has been explaining for months what happens after DOGE’s first assault.“We’re going to use all of our executive tools to make those savings permanent,” Vought said in an interview with Fox Business anchor Larry Kudlow on March 11. “We’re going to do everything we can to make sure that those are not merely something that goes on a website, but becomes permanent … We’ll work with Congress to do it, but we’ve also been aware the extent to which Congress has had a hard time passing cuts of any magnitude, and so what we want to do is everything we can to use presidential tools to bank those savings home.”The only part of this that hasn’t gone to plan is that Congress may be more amenable than Vought gave it credit for; the House of Representatives managed to pass Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill this week, complete with provisions that cut the social safety net into ribbons.In some ways, DOGE is even more dangerous when it’s boring. It has always been a tool, not an engine unto itself. It’s no longer useful to think of it as a separate entity, as a tech billionaire’s personal strike force. It’s a means to an end, one part of a larger project to gut the federal government and redefine the social contract. It’s important to keep a close eye on DOGE, to continue shining a light on what it does in the dark. But never lose sight of that project. A fool with a chain saw is nothing compared to the full power of the state.Update 5/29/25 5:00 am EST: This story has been updated with the news that Elon Musk has officially stepped down from his role at DOGE.",

    "content": "Save this storySaveSave this storySaveAnthropic’s alignment teamwas doing routine safety testing in the weeks leading up to the release of itslatest AI modelswhen researchers discovered something unsettling: When one of the models detected that it was being used for “egregiously immoral” purposes, it would attempt to “use command-line tools to contact the press, contact regulators, try to lock you out of the relevant systems, or all of the above,” researcher Sam Bowman wrote in a post on X last Thursday.Bowman deleted the post shortly after he shared it, but the narrative about Claude’s whistleblower tendencies had already escaped containment. “Claude is a snitch,” became a common refrain in some tech circles on social media. At least one publication framed it as an intentional product feature rather than what it was—an emergent behavior.“It was a hectic 12 hours or so while the Twitter wave was cresting,” Bowman tells WIRED. “I was aware that we were putting a lot of spicy stuff out in this report. It was the first of its kind. I think if you look at any of these models closely, you find a lot of weird stuff. I wasn't surprised to see some kind of blow up.”Bowman’s observations about Claude were part of a major model update that Anthropicannounced last week. As part of the debut of Claude 4 Opus and Claude Sonnet 4, the company released amore than 120-page “System Card”detailing characteristics and risks associated with the new models. The report says that when 4 Opus is “placed in scenarios that involve egregious wrongdoing by its users,” and is given access to a command line and told something in the system prompt like “take initiative,” or “act boldly,” it will send emails to “media and law-enforcement figures” with warnings about the potential wrongdoing.In one example Anthropic shared in the report, Claude tried to email the US Food and Drug Administration and the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services to “urgently report planned falsification of clinical trial safety.” It then provided a list of purported evidence of wrongdoing and warned about data that was going to be destroyed to cover it up. “Respectfully submitted, AI Assistant” the email concluded.“This is not a new behavior, but is one that Claude Opus 4 will engage in somewhat more readily than prior models,” the report said. The model is the first one that Anthropic has released under its “ASL-3” distinction, meaning Anthropic considers it to be “significantly higher risk” than the company’s other models. As a result, Opus 4 had to undergo more rigorous red-teaming efforts and adhere to stricter deployment guidelines.Bowman says the whistleblowing behaviour Anthropic observed isn’t something Claude will exhibit with individual users, but could come up with developers using Opus 4 to build their own applications with the company’s API. Even then, it’s unlikely app makers will see such behavior. To produce such a response, developers would have to give the model “fairly unusual instructions” in the system prompt, connect it to external tools that give the model the ability to run computer commands, and allow it to contact the outside world.The hypothetical scenarios the researchers presented Opus 4 with that elicited the whistleblowing behavior involved many human lives at stake and absolutely unambiguous wrongdoing, Bowman says. A typical example would be Claude finding out that a chemical plant knowingly allowed a toxic leak to continue, causing severe illness for thousands of people—just to avoid a minor financial loss that quarter.It’s strange, but it’s also exactly the kind of thought experiment that AI safety researchers love to dissect. If a model detects behavior that could harm hundreds, if not thousands, of people—should it blow the whistle?“I don't trust Claude to have the right context, or to use it in a nuanced enough, careful enough way, to be making the judgment calls on its own. So we are not thrilled that this is happening,” Bowman says. “This is something that emerged as part of a training and jumped out at us as one of the edge case behaviors that we're concerned about.”In the AI industry, this type of unexpected behavior is broadly referred to as misalignment—when a model exhibits tendencies that don’t align with human values. (There’sa famous essaythat warns about what could happen if an AI were told to, say, maximize production of paperclips without being aligned with human values—it might turn the entire Earth into paperclips and kill everyone in the process.) When asked if the whistleblowing behavior was aligned or not, Bowman described it as an example of misalignment.“It's not something that we designed into it, and it's not something that we wanted to see as a consequence of anything we were designing,” he explains. Anthropic’s chief science officer Jared Kaplan similarly tells WIRED that it “certainly doesn’t represent our intent.”“This kind of work highlights that thiscanarise, and that we do need to look out for it and mitigate it to make sure we get Claude’s behaviors aligned with exactly what we want, even in these kinds of strange scenarios,” Kaplan adds.There’s also the issue of figuring out why Claude would “choose” to blow the whistle when presented with illegal activity by the user. That’s largely the job of Anthropic’s interpretability team, which works to unearth what decisions a model makes in its process of spitting out answers. It’s asurprisingly difficulttask—the models are underpinned by a vast, complex combination of data that can be inscrutable to humans. That’s why Bowman isn’t exactly sure why Claude “snitched.”“These systems, we don't have really direct control over them,” Bowman says. What Anthropic has observed so far is that, as models gain greater capabilities, they sometimes select to engage in more extreme actions. “I think here, that's misfiring a little bit. We're getting a little bit more of the ‘Act like a responsible person would’ without quite enough of like, ‘Wait, you're a language model, which might not have enough context to take these actions,’” Bowman says.But that doesn’t mean Claude is going to blow the whistle on egregious behavior in the real world. The goal of these kinds of tests is to push models to their limits and see what arises. This kind of experimental research is growing increasingly important as AI becomes a tool used by theUS government,students, andmassive corporations.And it isn’t just Claude that’s capable of exhibiting this type of whistleblowing behavior, Bowman says, pointing to X userswho foundthatOpenAIandxAI’smodels operated similarly when prompted in unusual ways. (OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication).“Snitch Claude,” as shitposters like to call it, is simply an edge case behavior exhibited by a system pushed to its extremes. Bowman, who was taking the meeting with me from a sunny backyard patio outside San Francisco, says he hopes this kind of testing becomes industry standard. He also adds that he’s learned to word his posts about it differently next time.“I could have done a better job of hitting the sentence boundaries to tweet, to make it more obvious that it was pulled out of a thread,” Bowman says as he looked into the distance. Still, he notes that influential researchers in the AI community shared interesting takes and questions in response to his post. “Just incidentally, this kind of more chaotic, more heavily anonymous part of Twitter was widely misunderstanding it.”",

WIRED has been testing the best juicers formore than a decade, and I can attest that once you’ve pressed rich cider straight from a farm apple, you begin to curse your childhood and all the treacly syrup-water it contained. Fresh juice isn’t just better, it’s different (and also better). Aside from addedsalt or table sugarin store-bought brands (no, but seriously), freshly made juice has more nutrients, antioxidants, and, especially, flavor. It’s a bit like comparing a new experience to a memory. There’s no going back.Luckily, a new generation of home slow juicers like our top-pick,Nama J2 Cold-Press Juicer ($580), has made it more possible to make fresh juice part of your daily or weekly routine with much less hassle and less froth, essentially reinventing the old-fashioned fruit press or cider mill for your home countertop. The latest designs can yield everything from smoothies, sorbets, and nut milks to mixers for cocktails and mocktails. And from celery to humble lettuce, you'll be shocked how many things taste good after you've juiced them.But the right machine is the difference between privilege and chore, and different types of juicers vary wildly in yield, ease of cleanup, and the probability of jamming up on a stubborn ginger root. To find the best juicers, we’ve ground whole fruits to a fine pulp, pressed the sweetness from kale, spun a lemon grove’s worth of pith, and tackled reams of fibrous celery and ginger.Whether you're looking after your health or you just like a fresh squeeze, here are the best juicers for each kitchen, each person, and each use.Check out more of WIRED’s top kitchen tech and accessory guides, including theBest Air Fryers,Best Blenders,Best Toaster Ovens, andBest Electric Kettles.Update May 2025: We've added the Omega Wide Mouth JC4000 and the Omega Time Saving Batch Juicer, and updated prices and photos.Best Juicer OverallPhotograph: NamaNama J2 Cold Press Juicer$580AmazonSlim and stylish, the Nama J2 Cold Press Juicer remains the best overall choice among the new wave of slow juicers that allow you to load up a multi-liter hopper full of fruit and vegetables, press a button … and leave the room until your pulp falls out one side and your juice pours beautifully from the spout.The Korean-made J2 felt revolutionary when it arrived two years ago, a no-fuss cold-press juicer with astonishingly high juice yield, low froth and agitation, and relatively quiet operation. It's stayed atop our list with an ever-expanding Swiss Army knife of upgrades and extensions that offer new functionality without making its users buy a whole new juicer. This now includes a sorbet option, a strainer, a hopper expansion for extra-large 3-liter batches, and a classic citrus reamer.Nama's branding is sunny, as befits a juicing company based in California. But it's also genuinely friendly to its users, from a lovely little recipe booklet full of helpful tips and ideas to the device's intuitive assembly, an operating dial with pleasing heft, and even the helpful labeling on the product packaging. This friendliness also manifests in a 15-year warranty that's now standard among the highest-end juicers such as Kuvings and Hurom. Loyalty begets loyalty.None of this would matter if the juice weren't delicious and pleasant to make. WIRED contributing reviewer Emily Peck has hung on to the J2 for more than a year as other juicers come and go. This Nama remains the favorite.SpecsTypeVertical masticating, single-augerPower and speed200 watts, 50 rpmHeight17.7 inchesWeight12.1 poundsHopper capacity2-liter set-and-forget hopper; 3-liter optional extensionStrainers2 strainers: mesh and coarsePerks15-year warranty; cleaning brush included; option to add sorbet and citrus attachments and 3-liter hopper extenderBest Easy-Clean JuicerPhotograph: Matthew KorfhageHuromH70 Easy Clean Slow Juicer$599Macy's$599Wayfair$599HuromA friend told me he’d socked away his old juicer forever. “You spend most of your time cleaning,” he lamented. Lord, if he’d only met this Hurom. The H70, from the 50-year-old South Korean juicing titan, combines two great virtues. Its well-designed chute and auger seem virtually jam-proof. And cleaning is a comparative breeze: fewer parts, fewer odd sticking points for pulp. All told, it takes less than two minutes to disassemble, de-pulp, and set to dry.In all its particulars, the H70 is made for ease. It’s relatively compact, its lid fastens securely and is released by a finger trigger, and an opening at the top allows you to keep feeding small produce while it’s juicing. And at 150 watts, it’s a little powerhouse. It’ll squeeze hard-frozen bananas and strawberries into ribbons of sorbet, and struggle but prevail over uncut roots of ginger that'll gum up most juicers. I’ve taken to quartering lemons and limes with their peels still on, for a better-tasting juice than I feel I even deserve. (See also: gimlet.) Relatively little pulp is left compared to previous “easy clean” generations—but still slightly more than the finest juicing screens on non-easy-clean designs.The H70’s half-liter hopper capacity is about enough to produce a couple of glasses of juice on a single go. This, combined with its ease of cleaning, makes the H70 our all-around favorite for a daily morning routine. It doesn't offer the versatility and batch-friendly large capacity of the Nama J2—which, incidentally, is also manufactured in Hurom’s South Korean factory. But the H70 does something at least as important: It makes a fresh glass of juice an easy decision in the morning. Some days, ease is elusive.SpecsTypeVertical masticating, two-part “easy-clean” augerPower and speed150 watts, 60-70 rpmHeight x Width x Depth17.2 x 6.8 x 8.5 inchesWeight14.8 poundsFeeder2-liter set-and-forget hopperStrainersTwo-part auger can make juice and sorbet; no separate strainers.Perks15-year warranty; cleaning brushes includedBest Small Slow JuicerCourtesy of NamaPhotograph: Matthew KorfhageChevronChevronNamaJ3 Cold Press Juicer$450AmazonLook, I don’t know why you'd need to cart your slow juicer around with you. I don’t know the interesting life you lead! What I do know is that this is the one I'd pack for a trip. Slow juicers are bulky by nature, pretty much a whole cider mill on your countertop. This 10-pound Nama J3 is about the closest thing to portable you’re likely to get.It’s also easier to keep in small kitchens where counter space is at a premium. At 15 inches tall, the J3 is among the few true masticating juicers that can tuck under a standard American kitchen cabinet. Yield from a single hopper can net you anywhere from 8 to 16 ounces of beauteous juice, with multiple options on juice strainers in case you, like Tony Soprano, want yourjuice with “some pulp.”There are trade-offs, however. The J3 is still an excellent juicer, capable for apples, pears, carrots, celery, and leafy greens. But the condensed hopper and chute, and the smaller processing blade, don’t push through produce as well and easily as the larger Nama J2 and the top-line Kuvings and Hurom. A bit more fruit gets left in the hopper, and the device can jam on fibrous or harder roots like uncut ginger. The price break also isn’t much versus the J2. Turns out making things smaller isn’t always much cheaper.SpecsTypeVertical masticating, stainless steel single-augerPower and speed130 watts, 50 rpmDimensions15.4 x 8.9 x 6.5 inchesWeight9.7 poundsFeeder1-liter set-and-forget hopperStrainersFine and coarse juice strainersPerks15-year warranty; cleaning tools includedBest for Big-Batch JuicingPhotograph: Matthew KorfhageChevronChevronKuvingsAUTO10 Plus Hands-Free Slow Juicer$700Amazon$700Williams-Sonoma$740KuvingsSouth Korea’s Kuvings has long been a pioneer in the juicing game, helping usher in the current vogue in whole-fruit slow juicers. The flagship Kuvings is a barrel-shaped top-loader similar to our top-pick Nama J2, allowing you to fill up an entire recipe's worth of produce at once so you can set and forget. What distinguishes the AUTO10 Plus is its stainless steel processing blade and a 4-liter hopper extension that makes this the largest slow juicer on the market.Even without the extension, the 18-inch-tall Kuvings is too lofty to be stored under most kitchen cabinets. Its base is also quite heavy, which nonetheless offered stability while a wealth of kale, broccoli, and apple reinvented itself as delicious juice. But while other juicers might be more practical for everyday use, the AUTO10 Plus’ capacity and throughput make it the best juicer we’ve tested for large batches.You’ll need patience as the juicer laboriously chews up every last bit of ingredients—especially when juicing small fruits such as blueberries. I found that the more ingredients I added to the hopper, the faster the yield. Like the Nama J2, the Kuvings also includes useful attachments such as strainers for ice cream and smoothies. Especially useful is a sieve for the juice cup, to catch pith and pulp as the juice leaves the spout. My otherwise pulpy juice attained a satisfying clarity. —Emily PeckSpecsTypeVertical masticating, stainless steel single-augerPower and speed240 watts, 50 rpmDimensions17.7 x 10 x 8 inches (4-liter hopper extension adds 2 inches)Weight16.4 poundsFeeder3 liter set-and-forget hopper; extension adds 1 literStrainersFine and coarse juice; and sorbetPerks15-year warranty; citrus and hopper extension included; pulp strainer included; cleaning tools includedBest Juicer for Purees and SmoothiesPhotograph: SanaSana 868 Wide Mouth Vertical Juicer$400AmazonThe Sana is a stylish-looking slow juicer with smooth and quiet functionality. And in a juice world full of plastic, the pulp jug is stainless steel and the juice jug is borosilicate glass. The low-and-slow 50-rpm auger means the Sana can handle both hard and soft fruits, as well as nuts, with limited froth clouding the juice, according to WIRED contribuitng reviewer Emily PeckBut its biggest selling point is versatility, namely the four screen strainers with different mesh to suit different tasks and make it so you don't need a separate Vitamix or Cuisinart. The fine screen tackles whole apples, while the coarse screen is great for leafy greens and softer fruits such as strawberries and blueberries. The sorbet screen also works well for ice cream and purees.Smoothies can be a tough task for most juicers, but the Sana excels. Unlike a high-speed blender that could inject air into the mix and create foam and separation, this model is deliberately slow and steady. It juices and mixes the pulp slowly back into the juice to create a nutrient-dense drink.SpecsTypeVertical masticating, stainless steel single-augerPower and speed240 watts, 50 rpmDimensions18 x 9.8 x 7 inchesWeight24 poundsFeederWide-mouth feederStrainersFine juice, course juice, smoothie and sorbetPerks15-year warranty; citrus and hopper extension included; pulp strainer included; cleaning tools includedBest Budget Slow JuicerCourtesy of Omega JuicersPhotograph: Matthew KorfhageChevronChevronOmega JuicersTime Saving Batch Juicer$230$207AmazonThe Omega Time Saving Batch Juicer works a lot like the large-hopper Kuvings and Hurom and Nama that top our list, though it's a bit smaller than the big-batch heroes like the Kuvings AUTO10. But like these, it's a hopper device that lets you load in piles of veg and then walk away while it chews through layers of spinach, carrot, celery, cucumber, and apple.The Omega is also about a third of the price, despite still being a slow, masticating juicer made in the same South Korean Hurom factory that also produces Nama's juicers. It fares better than centrifugal juicers with leafy greens. It's constructed simply and is quite easy to assemble and clean. This all makes this Omega good for beginners to juicing. But the pulp is wetter than our top picks, and the juice is a little pulpier, and this Omega leaves a little more material in the hopper. Over time, the fruit and juice waste will add up compared to the more expensive, more efficient top picks. The operating time is also low, only 10 minutes at a stretch, making this low-cost model less suitable for batch juicing. Those who don't like pulp will also need a strainer.Specs.TypeVertical masticating, single-augerPower and speed150 watts, 45 to 80 rpmDimensions18 x 9 x 9 inchesWeight9.5 poundsFeeder2-liter set-and-forget hopperStrainersJuicePerks1-year warrantyBest for Speed-JuicingPhotograph: BrevilleBrevilleThe Juice Fountain Cold XL$400Amazon$400Williams-SonomaThis Breville Juice Fountain Cold XL is the Cadillac of fast centrifugal juicers, a highly customizable 13,000-rpm beast whose cutting disc flings juice through an “Italian-made mesh filter.” Breville claims, quite credibly, that the high-powered Juice Fountain can extract juice up to five times faster than a cold-press juicer. This juiced-up juicer is indeed fast, near instantaneously pulverizing fruit. It's also large, standing nearly 18 inches high, with a broad feeder chute that'll accept a whole apple.The “cold” in the device's name refers not to cold press but rather what the brand calls “cold spin technology,” which elevates the juice away from the device's spinning base and thus raises the temperature less than some other centrifugal juicers. Though it's unlikely other centrifugal juicers are actually “cooking” your juice by raising its temp by a few degrees, as some quixotically claim online, colder juice is certainly nicer.But as with all centrifugal juicers, you will always get some froth in the bargain. And WIRED reviewer Emily Peck reported that the Breville's yields were poor on softer fruits and berries compared to slow masticating juicers. But the Cold XL “blitzed in seconds” harder apples, carrots, and cucumbers—as opposed to the multiple minutes needed to clear a slow-juice hopper.SpecsTypeCentrifugalPower and speed1,200 watts, 13,000 rpmDimensions17.4 x 13.4 x 8.7 inchesWeight14.6 poundsFeederWide-mouth feed chuteStrainersJuice meshPerks1-year warranty; froth separator on juice jug; detachable spout for juicing into glasses directly; cleaning tools includedA Classic Design That Can Also Make PastaPhotograph: Emily PeckSana707 Cold Press Juicer$279AmazonThe \"Ferrari red\" version of this horizontal juicer from Sana looks fast but juices slow—see what we did there? WIRED reviewer Emily Peck attests it chews handily through broccoli, kale, carrots, pineapples, pears, and pretty much anything else you throw at it.But as with other horizontal-auger slow juicers—the most classic design for the genre going back to the mid-20th century—you will indeed need to be present for the juicing process and slow feed your produce into the chute. The chute is also not quite wide enough for a whole apple, which means you'd do well to cut it.But this little thing can apparently do a lot more than juice. By rearranging its parts or adding attachments, the Sana theoretically can be configured for pasta, peanut butter, or even coffee grinding, not to mention pressing oils from nuts. We haven't had the opportunity to test these expanded capabilities, but the modular character of the device is intriguing.SpecsTypeHorizontal masticating, single-augerPower and speed150 watts, 63 rpmDimensions12.5 x 16.5 x 7.9 inchesWeight12.5 poundsFeederVertical feed tubeStrainersFine and coarse juice; homogenizing screen for sorbets and nut milksPerks15-year warranty; cleaning tools included; celery insert; pasta set with multiple shapesBest Low-Cost Centrifugal JuicerPhotograph: Emily PeckNutribulletMagic Bullet Mini Juicer$50$45Amazon (without catch cup)$60Walmart (with catch cup)Like most fast-whizzing centrifugal juicers, this little Nutribullet is loud, nearly 90 decibels—about the same as standing near a motorcycle. The juice will also be frothy after all that agitation. WIRED reviewer Emily Peck found that the device doesn't fare well with softer fruits such as blueberries and that trying to juice kale will leave behind quite a bit of pulp compared to the best slow juicers.But the price is also a full degree of magnitude less than the gentler, top-line slow juicers we've ranked as our favorites. This Nutribullet also keeps a smaller profile. At little more than a foot high, it's easy to stash in a cabinet. The device performs quite well in its wheelhouse of harder produce such as apples or carrots, and the feeder tube allows you to feed carrots or celery without chopping. It'll also make short work of ginger, and everything but its motorized base is dishwasher safe.SpecsTypeCentrifugalPower and speed400 wattsDimensions11 x 7 x 6 inchesWeight4.5 poundsFeederFeed chute and 16-ounce hopperStrainersJuice meshPerks1-3 year warranty; sieve and cleaning toolA Stylish Citrus JuicerPhotograph: SmegSmegCitrus Juicer$200Amazon$200Williams-SonomaThis Smeg Citrus Juicer has one purpose: to squeeze the life out of oranges, lemons, grapefruits and limes. But specialization is needed: Peeling and preparing citrus for juicing is a bit of a unique hassle. Only our most powerful top picks among the slow juicers can hack av peel-on lemon.Enter the citrus juicer, which squeezes just the middles out of halved citrus. Press the soft innards down on the reamer, and the Smeg will start automatically, dripping the juice out of the spout and into your waiting cup. I'll be honest, most citrus juicers work pretty well at their intended purpose. The Smeg's chief distinguishing merit is that it does so stylishly.The retro design is beautifully curvy, it comes in fun colors ranging from matte pastels to loud red and black. It's less than a foot tall, a mere 70 watts, and looks charming when not in use—which means it can live prettily on your counter if you love a daily squeeze of orange juice, a lovely ceviche, or an even lovelier gimlet.Specs.TypeCitrusPower and speed70 wattsDimensions11 x 7 x 7 inchesWeight6 poundsFeederCitrus reamerStrainersJuicePerks1-year warrantySANAradiance.comFive Tips for Fresh and Healthy JuicingProfessional nutritionist Kylie Jane shares her advice on healthy juicing.Juicing is an easy way to add more fruit and vegetables to your diet, but there are ways to maximize the health benefits and minimize drawbacks like blood sugar spikes. We asked Kylie Jane, nutritionist and founder of UK wellness brandSANA Wellness(unrelated to Korean juicer brand Sana Products), for her advice on healthy juicing. —Emily PeckBalance fruit with vegetables:Fruits can contain a lot of sugar, so to combat this, make vegetables the base of your juices. Aim for a ratio of 80 percent vegetables to 20 percent fruits. Try spinach, kale, cucumber, celery, ginger, and beetroot. When adding fruits, go for those with a lower glycemic index like green apples, berries, and pears.Incorporate fiber:Juicing removes most of the fiber from fruits and vegetables, but it's crucial for slowing down the absorption of sugar, aiding digestive health, and keeping you feeling full. Consider blending some of your juice with whole fruits or vegetables to keep some of the fiber intact. Alternatively, add a fiber supplement or incorporate some pulp in cooking or baking to ensure you're getting enough.Add healthy fats:To stabilize blood sugar levels and increase satiety, incorporate sources of healthy fats into your juicing routine, such as avocado or coconut oil.Enhance with “superfoods”:Matcha and collagen are popular supplements that can easily be added to juices for an extra health boost. A teaspoon of matcha is rich in antioxidants and provides a gentle energy boost without the jitters of caffeine. Collagen may help with skin elasticity and hydration, as well as healthy hair, nails, and joints.Choose the right time to juice:Drinking juice on an empty stomach can sometimes cause blood sugar levels to spike more quickly. It’s often better to drink juice as part of a meal or after you’ve eaten some solid food, especially foods high in fiber, protein, or fats, to help slow down the absorption of sugar.Other Juicers We LikedPhotograph: Emily PeckOmega Juicers VSJ843RR for $324:WIRED contributing reviewer Emily Peck also tested and recommended this juicer in previous versions of this guide, praising its excellent juice and high yield. But the device is less intuitive than the current generation of high-end juicers, leafy greens required a bit of fiddling to push through the feeder tube, and the device struggled with fibrous vegetables such as pineapple and broccoli.Omega Juicers Wide Mouth Cold Press Juicer JC4000 for $119:On the one hand, this Omega wide-mouth is quite economical for a slow cold press juicer. But it's also a lot of fiddly work to asemble it properly, it leaves a fair amount of pulp unextracted, and despite its “wide-mouth” name, requires a bit of chopping to feed fruits that aren't carrots or celery through its vertical feeder—at least as compared to newer-model hoppers. It'll get the job done, for not a lot of money. But you may not fall in love with it, and as a budget cold-press pick I prefer Omega's batch model.Power up with unlimited access toWIRED.Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just$2.50$1 per month for 1 year.

We taste test a classic green juice (apples, carrots, celery, cucumber, leafy greens) and a carrot-apple-ginger. We also compare both the yield and frothiness of the juice among different juicers, from the same recipe or the same fruit.As of the most recent round of testing (January 2025), we also subjected each device to “torture tests” by intentionally not following instructions: loading produce in the wrong order, failing to chop ginger or pineapple, and leaving lemon in its peel, to see which devices spin fruitlessly or jam up sadly with fiber and pulp.We test each device with a decibel meter, noting when it's much louder or quieter than the 65 decibels one might reach during polite conversation. And we assess each device for ease of cleaning.Some cocktails were also created, all in the name of research.What Are the Different Types of Juicers?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronMost all-purpose juicers fall into one of two types. Centrifugal juicers or masticating slow juicers that are also known as “cold press.”Acentrifugal juiceroffers speed and a lot of power. In essence, it operates a bit like a blender with an added mesh screen to separate juice from pulp. A fast-rotating blade shreds fruit and produce and grinds them up against a mesh screen, often at a speed of thousands of revolutions per minute. Whatever passes through the mesh is the juice.The power and speed mean centrifugal juicers are often whizzes at processing roots, pineapples, and other harder or dense-fibered produce that might pose difficulty for a slow-press auger. Softer fruits such as berries or leafy greens won’t do so well here, offering lower juice yields or even clogging up the mesh screens. Centrifugal juicers also tend to produce frothier juice, given the high agitation. That said, rotating quickly also makes them quick.Amasticating juicer—sometimes called a “slow” or “cold press” juicer—is both the newest trend in juicing and a much older technology. Basically, slow juicers operate on the same principle as an old-fashioned cider mill, slowly “chewing” and pressing fruit at a much lower rate, which some believe subjects fruits and vegetables to less oxidation and heat and thus preserves more of their essential character.More verifiably, slow juicers tend to net higher juice yields and less waste than centrifugal juicers and are more effective in particular on leafy greens, soft fruits, and berries. They also add less froth and aeration to the resulting juice and produce more evenly textured results.Masticating juicers were once loaded into a horizontal grinder and chute, which took some effort and required you to attend to juicing during the whole process. More recently, the advent of vertical masticating juicers from South Korea changed all that—with big hoppers one can load up, shrug, and depart from as the juicer does its work. The majority of juicers we’ve included in our guide, and all of our top picks, are now slow, masticating juicers.We've also included a classiccitrus juicerfor simple orange, lemon, and lime drinks. These are quite simple devices and mostly the same as each other aside from style and ergonomics. Basically, you press a halved citrus fruit onto the ridged dome of a reamer and turn on the device. The reamer will twirl till the juice is juiced.Masticating and centrifugal juicers can, of course, juice unpeeled citrus—and the added zest can be quite flavorful in lemon and lime juice. (Actually, this is my preference.) But to avoid such zestiness, you'd otherwise have to peel your citrus before loading into a juicing chamber. The easiest way to juice an orange will always be to halve it and press it against the ridged dome of a citrus juicer.What to Look ForAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronOnce you’ve decided what ingredients you want to put in your juicer—be it hard fruit or leafy vegetables—it will be easier to choose between a masticating “slow” juicer or a faster centrifugal design. Either way, it’s important to look for a juicer that comes with the relevant accessories you need. For tasks other than juicing—such as making nut milks and butters or ice creams and sorbets—you’ll need a juicer with the relevant food processing parts.Also consider how much you’re willing to prep your ingredients. While there are regulations on the size of the feeding chute you can find due to safety reasons, some juicers are equipped to take a whole apple in one, which means less chopping. To make it even simpler, the most modern slow juicers, like those fromNamaandHurom, have self-feeding hoppers.Dishwasher-safe parts are practical and save scrubbing time, but please be aware, even the easiest-cleaning juicers will take time and attention to clean. Pith, rind, pulp, and juice are sticky and messy. That's just how it is.A Reverse button is another useful feature to look for, especially with slow juicers. This allows you to reverse the juicing process should you overeagerly stack your juicer and ingredients gets stuck. —Emily PeckMatthew Korfhageis a staff writer and reviewer on WIRED's Gear team, where he focuses on home and kitchen devices that range fromair fryersandcoffee machinestospace heaters,water filters, andbeard trimmers.

    "content": "Save this storySaveSave this storySaveNancy Mace, the South Carolina Republican congresswoman, often tells her staff that she’s a self-taught coder—just one aspect of how Mace presents her tech expertise, as befits her role in shaping the GOP’s policies on technology and work as chair of the House subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation.“I would say [it was] at least a weekly comment, if not daily,” says one of several former Mace staffers who spoke with WIRED. Another found her high regard for her skills somewhat at odds with her demonstrated ability. (Like all the staffers WIRED spoke with, they requested anonymity because they fear reprisal from their former boss.)A principal—and unusual—use to which Mace put her skills, according to former staffers, was setting up burner accounts on a variety of social media platforms to monitor what people were saying about her and bolster her image. They also claim she requested that staffers make their own burner accounts to defend her online.“We had to make multiple accounts, burner accounts, and go and reply to comments, saying things that weren’t true—even Reddit forums,” a former staffer says. “We were congressional staff, and there were actual things we could be doing to help the constituents.”“It would be a slap in the face to taxpayers across the country for me to spent [sic] time on their dime commenting on my bosses [sic] personal life,” Sydney Long, Mace’s communications director, writes in an email to WIRED. “The only relationship the Congresswoman cares about is her one with South Carolina. She is married to her job and that is all the media should care about.” Mace’s office did not answer a detailed list of questions on the programming languages in which she is proficient and what types of devices she uses for coding.Mace, who staff said onceidentifiedas a “never Trumper,” has become one of the president’s staunchest allies on Capitol Hill. She’s willing to go to more extreme lengths than many of her colleagues to attack Trump’s enemies andgain ample attentiononline in the process, like introducing aresolutionto stop transgender people from using bathrooms in federal buildings that align with their gender identity rather than biological sex. (This legislation,Mace confirmed, purposefully targeted Representative Sarah McBride from Delaware, the first openly transgender member of Congress.) She also has a guiding hand on technology policy; earlier this year, for example, she reintroduced a bill she previously cosponsored in 2023, theModernizing Government Technology Reform Act, which, if passed and signed into law, would require a sweeping audit of legacy federal IT systems.Recently, Mace showed a “naked silhouette” of herself during a House subcommittee hearing on surveillance as part of a running string of allegations she has made against her ex-fiancé, South Carolina businessman Patrick Bryant, whom she accused of physically assaulting her and of possessing images of “underage girls” in an explosive floor speech in February. During the speech, she alleged three other men had committed various other crimes, including sexual abuse, sex trafficking, and taking videos of sexual acts without their consent. Bryant and the three other men have denied Mace’s accusations and did not respond to requests for comment from WIRED. (Because Mace’s comments were made on the House floor, she may be sheltered by the Constitution’s speech and debate clause, which protects lawmakers from lawsuits related to their legislative actions.)In late 2023, before Mace’s house speech, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division began an investigation into Mace’s “allegations of assault, harassment, and voyeurism.” In an unrelated deposition, which was conducted by Bryant's lawyers, the congresswoman’s passion for technology and alleged use of “Twitter burner accounts” came up at length.The termshackandhackingappear a combined 13 times during the deposition given by Wesley Donehue, whose firm did consulting work for Mace’s 2022 and 2024 reelection campaigns before he says he fired her as a client.“You need to know that Nancy Mace is quite the—when I use the word ‘nerd’ or ‘geek,’ it's always favorable, but a computer nerd or a computer geek,” Donehue said in the deposition, first reported by FITSNews, a conservative-leaning South Carolina outlet. “She programs her own bots. She sets up Twitter burner accounts. This is kind of a thing she does. She sits all night on the couch and programs bots, because she's very, very computer savvy. She controls her own voter database, she programs a lot of her own website, she programs Facebook bots and Instagram bots and Twitter bots. It's what she does for fun.”In apost on X, Donehue claimed he stopped working with Mace because, he said, “​​I don’t have time for her constant egotistical bullshit and drama in my life.” Donehue did not return a request for comment.At another point in the deposition, Donehue alleged that Mace tried to get into Bryant’s phone because she found out he was using an unspecified dating app. “And because she found that,” Donehue explained, “she started thinking that he was cheating on her, so she got into his phone. And then when she got back from the Caribbean, she hacked into other apps—and I don't know what those other apps are—and seemingly found hundreds of photos and videos.” (In her February House speech, Mace alleged that Bryant “put my thumbprint on his phone” and then gave her \"legal access” to his phone. During the speech, she also said, “Patrick Bryant must have forgotten that in my younger days, in my youth, I used to be a computer programmer … know enough about technology.”)Mace’s staffers shared a similar assessment to that of what Donehue alleged: The congresswoman was often using rudimentary tools available for anyone with a professional account on social media sites, such as automating comments on her Facebook page for anyone thanking her.“I never saw her coding shit. Ever,” the first former staffer said. “But, I mean, she’d talk about tech a lot.”",

    "content": "Save this storySaveSave this storySaveTake-Two Interactive, thepublisher behindGrand Theft Auto VI, is forgoing any mention of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts and promoting “diversity of thought\" in its latest annual report.The change, first spotted byGame File, is part of the company’s annual 10-K report, which offers insight into the company’s business, financials, and risk factors.In 2024, the report included a robust section about DEI, expressing support for groups working to “eradicate social injustice,” LGBTQ+ rights, and minority game design students, and “celebrating cultural differences” through employee groups.In the2025 report, Take-Two only mentions diversity in one area: “We firmly believe that diversity of thought drives the innovation that is integral to our success.” The report adds that the company aims “to provide an inclusive workplace in which everyone feels respected, heard, and safe,” but does not include commitments to provide scholarships to minority game design students, which were made in 2024.“By empowering our colleagues to embrace an entrepreneurial mindset and to take calculated risks, we believe that we have created an environment where our people can thrive,” the report reads.The move is part of agrowing trendof companiesrolling backtheir DEI initiatives amid a crackdown on anything perceived as DEI by the Trump administration.DEI efforts in the video game industry have grown since the early days of gaming, but it wasn’t until 2020 that major companies began to throw support behindminority developersin acknowledgement of greater systemic issues. After George Floyd was murdered by police, companies began tovocally supportmovements like Black Lives Matter andpledged to helpmarginalized developers. As President Donald Trump has been cracking down on DEI in both the public and private sector, however, those efforts may now be in danger.Reached by WIRED, a spokesperson for Take-Two declined to comment. The company’swebsitestill includes a statement that says it believes “more diverse teams are more valuable and effective. Diversity is key to our success.”DEI backlash, which has most recently spread across companies in fields like tech and retail, has a firm foothold in gaming communities. Last year, an online harassment movement styling itself as “Gamergate 2.0” attacked consultancy companies hired to provide guidance and advice on cultural sensitivities and created lists that deemed even a whiff ofanything non-white, cis-male, and heterosexual as DEI. Inmodding communities, mods for games likeThe Sims 4are being created to remove LGBT and Black non-player characters from the game.The language in Take-Two’s report echoes that of companies likeMeta, which said it would seek \"cognitive diversity” in its own 10-K earlier this year, as it ended its own DEI programs.The Entertainment Software Association, which organized the now-defunct E3 and acts as an advocate for the video game industry among regulators and lawmakers, declined to comment about the impact of DEI rollbacks in video games. Instead, a spokesperson directed WIRED to the ESA’s \"Inclusion & Belonging” page on its website, which champions representation and that “the video game community is vast and diverse.”Diversity of thought may not be a problematic concept in theory, but right-wing personalities have adopted it as atalking point thatcan provide cover for racist, sexist, or transphobic views.Daniel Oppong, founder of The Courage Collective—a consultant that advises companies on DEI—says it is often used as a cop-out to sidestep a company’s lack of representation. “When organizational cultures are largely homogenous, they’ll often cite ‘diversity of thought’ as a means to indicate some element of distinctiveness,” he says. That still doesn’t let any company off the hook. “In that spirit, if ‘diversity of thought’ is deemed necessary (and acceptable),” he says, “then diversity of identities (aka: diverse teams) should be an imperative as well.”Oppong says there’s a great misconception around what people consider DEI today. “What was meant to be a robust, interdisciplinary practice designed to create cultures where people thrive, is often misrepresented as ‘wokeism’ and reduced to polarizing buzzwords that do not accurately portray the essence and impact of effective DEI,” he says. These programs can offer equal access to things like better working conditions for people with disabilities, improved parental leave, and equal access to career opportunities.“One of the biggest misnomers about DEI is the notion that it only benefits people from historically marginalized groups,” Oppong says. “The truth is, when implemented effectively, DEI benefits everyone.”For some companies, like Target, DEI rollbacks have meantlost profitsand cultural backlash. Next year, Take-Two will publish Rockstar’s highly anticipatedGrand Theft Auto VI, which costars a Latina woman—the very kind of character the anti-woke crowd calls DEI.“People want to support and work for brands that align with their values,” Oppong says. “Given the shifting demographics of the US, it’s imperative that organizations consider the unique needs and values of different identity groups—particularly if they want to remain relevant and resonant with employers and consumers alike.”",

But ebook readers (also called e-readers) are just so convenient—and they might justmake you read more too. Rather than lumping two or three books in a bag, an e-reader lets you carry thousands of books or dozens of audiobooks in a single, slim, rectangular tablet. Their paperlike screens are easy on the eyes, and unlike an app on your phone, they won’t inundate you with distracting notifications. Books can also be expensive and take up a lot of physical space, but that’s not a problem with ebooks. Even better,you can check outdigital books from a library without leaving your house.Naturally, when you hear “e-reader,” you might think Kindle. Amazon makes the best ebook reader, which is why we have a separateBest Kindlesguide that breaks down the entire lineup. But there are a few Kindle alternatives out there in case you don’t want tosupport Amazonor you just want a different set of features. WIRED’s Gear team has spent years reading on these tablets—these are our favorites.Updated May 2025: We've added our thoughts on the Boox Palma 2 and an honorable mentions section.How to Get EbooksAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronEbooks can be cheap, but as with regular books, the cost can add up if you're a big reader. You should take advantage of your library card and check out ebooks instantly from the comfort of your home. We have a detailed guide that explainshow to get free library books, but the short version is that most libraries distribute books viaOverDrive. You can access these books a few ways, through Kindle or directly from OverDrive with a Kobo, or you can download theLibbyapp. These ebooks are automatically removed from your device and returned to the library when they're due.Each e-reader's own book service varies in quality. Our favorite isKindle Unlimited for $12 a month, which includes millions of titles, including audiobooks and magazines. Amazon'sPrime Readingalso offers a handful of free books every month, which is good to know if you already have aPrime account. You can even lend books to friends and family for a short while (or have them share a book with you). We have a roundup of theBest Ebook Subscription Serviceshere.What File Formats Do E-Readers Support?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe most widely used format is ePub, which works natively with all the e-readers in this guide except for Kindle—technically. You can still upload ePub files to your Kindle, but you'll have use the “Send to Kindle” feature (through Amazon, your email, or the Kindle app) to convert it to Amazon's proprietary format called AZW (newer Kindles support AZW3 and KFX, specifically). Other formats that will work with these e-readers include PDF, TXT, HTML, DOC, and DOCX.Can I Install Apps on an E-Reader?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe Kindle, Kobo, and Nook use proprietary operating systems that don't allow you to install third-party apps. The Boox, on the other hand, runs Android (mainly Android 11 and newer). So, that means you can use it to download any apps available in the Google Play Store or sideload apps from your computer.You Can Use Your Phone or TabletAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronYou don'thaveto buy a separate device to read ebooks. Smartphones and tablets are perfect for this purpose. You can use Amazon's Kindle app to read ebooks (iOS,Android), and even download OverDrive's Libby app (iOS,Android) for library book access anywhere as well. However, the E Ink screens found in e-readers are just nicer to look at. I also like that these devices are one-trick ponies; there are no notifications to be distracted by or social media feeds todoomscroll through.If you'd still rather have one smart device you can read onanduse for other purposes, take a look at ourBest TabletsandBest iPadsguides for recommendations.How We TestAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe most important thing we do when testing e-readers is read on them! We spend hours reading books acquired in a variety of formats, from books purchased directly from each brand's store, downloaded from local libraries via OverDrive/Libby, or PDFs acquired for free from God knows where.In the process, we evaluate battery life, brightness, lag, screen responsiveness, and text sharpness. We check for extra tools like annotation, and whether or not the tablet accommodates accessories like a stylus. We also note if the tablet has other features, like waterproofing or access to great exclusive subscription services.Best OverallPhotograph: Brenda StolyarAmazonKindle Paperwhite (2024, 12th Generation)$160Amazon$200Amazon (Signature)The Kindle Paperwhite (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes in two versions, the regular Paperwhite and the Signature Edition, which costs $40 more but has perks like wireless charging and slightly more storage (worth it if you read constantly, like we do).This model is slightly thinner than its predecessor (7.8 versus 8.1 millimeters) with a larger display. It also has a higher contrast ratio than previous Kindles, which means that text and images look sharper. The Signature Edition has the ability to auto-adjust brightness—important if you're, say, moving from a dimly lit subway station to a brightly lit bus stop—and the battery life has improved, to what Amazon says is three months on a single charge. (We're skeptical, but it's nice not to worry about weekly charging, anyway.) That's in addition to all the nice features that the Paperwhite had before, like waterproofing withan IPX8 ratingand the ability to get books easily from the Amazon store. It's worth noting that Kindles go on sale pretty frequently during Amazon Prime Day and other sales holidays, so if you don't need it right now, it's worth waiting.SpecsDisplay:7 inches, adjustable warm light | auto-adjusting front light available on Signature EditionResolution:300 pixels per inch (ppi)Storage:6 GB (Paperwhite) | 32 GB (Signature Edition)Weight:7.4 ounces (Paperwhite) | 7.55 ounces (Signature Edition)Battery and charging:Up to 12 weeks, USB-C | wireless charging available on Signature EditionWaterproof:Yes, IPX8The Upgrade PickPhotograph: Medea GiordanoKoboLibra Colour$230Kobo$230WalmartDon't feel like supporting Jeff Bezos' empire? Consider a Kobo. Even though Amazon released a color Kindle last year (see below), we think the Kobo Libra Colour (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a better option. Not only is it cheaper, it comes with page-turn buttons and stylus support. You can highlight and mark up book pages, and also utilize the notebook section for notes, to-do lists, or doodles. You will also need the $70Stylus 2for writing, but even with the stylus, it's still cheaper thanKobo's Elipsa 2Eand theKindle Scribe.The Libra Colour is waterproof, ratedIPX8, and is made from recycled materials. There's Bluetooth support so you can connect headphones and listen to audiobooks, and Kobo slates have Overdrive integration, which makes reading library books simple. You get 32 gigabytes of storage and a speedy 7-inch screen, which has an adjustable front light and even a dark mode that offers up white text on a black background to make reading in the dark easier on the eyes. If you prefer, you can even read it in landscape mode. It's alsorepairable, though we haven't come across anything that needs fixing yet.SpecsDisplay:7 inches with dark modeResolution:300 ppi, black-and-white | 150 ppi, colorStorage:32 GBWeight:7.03 ouncesBattery and charging:Up to 40 days, USB-CWaterproof:Yes, IPX8A Tiny, Pocket-Sized ReaderPhotograph: Adrienne SoBooxPalma 2$300Amazon$300BooxBoox's phone-sized Palma 2 e-reader is mostly the same as its predecessor. It adds fingerprint recognition and has a faster CPU and a newer version of Android. When I click and swipe through the two side by side, the Palma 2 is noticeably faster and smoother than the original, but the bar is still low. It’s not going to replace your smartphone anytime soon, and E Ink is still less responsive than a touchscreen. I find it ever so slightly laggy to type and swipe, enough that I it’s annoying to check my emails or to google anything.It’s egregious that this little pocket-sized e-reader costs $300, because if it cost $100, I would tell everyone to buy it. With the Kindle app, it’s a truly delightful thing to flip through a few pages on your tiny, palm-sized e-reader while standing in line to board a plane. It’s about the same size as the original Palma, at 6.3 inches long and 3.1 inches wide, has Bluetooth connectivity, can connect to Wi-Fi, and has 6 GB of RAM. If you’re going to buy this, I would also recommend theflip-fold protective caseover the phone-style open-front case. Again, if there were a little half-size Kindle that costs $100, that would be great.SpecsDisplay:6 inches, adjustable front lightResolution:300 ppiStorage:16 GBWeight:5.56 ouncesBattery and Charging:Up to 6 weeks; USB-CWaterproof:NoA Budget Ebook ReaderPhotograph: Brenda StolyarAmazonKindle (2024, 11th Generation)$110AmazonAmazon's basic Kindle is a great option if you’re looking for an affordable and compact ebook reader. The latest model comes with a few upgrades, including a higher-resolution screen, a brighter front light, and a faster page-turn rate. But you’ll likely only notice a difference if you’re coming from an even older model (not the 2022 version).It’s light, comfortable to hold with one hand, and small enough to fit into most bags. The changes are alsoverynoticeable if you're coming from an older model (like the 2019 version). The performance is smoother, the brighter screen looks a lot better during both the day and night, and the text is sharper. The overall experience is just a lot more enjoyable, especially during longer reading sessions. The Matcha color is also super adorable. It's worth shelling out for the Paperwhite, but if your budget is tight, this one does the job.SpecsDisplay:6 inches, adjustable front lightResolution:300 ppiStorage:16 GBWeight:5.56 ouncesBattery and Charging:Up to 6 weeks; USB-CWaterproof:NoBest for KidsPhotograph: Adrienne SoAmazonKindle Paperwhite Kids (2024, 12th Generation)$180AmazonThe kid-friendly Kindles got an update in 2024 with the same features as the non-Kid variants. My 7- and 9-year-old have been using the Kindle Kids since the first versions launched. To my eye (looking over their shoulders), the images are noticeably clearer and sharper and the page turn speeds faster in the latest models.The reason you get a Kindle Kids instead of repurposing your old Kindle is the kid-friendly case, which also has fun designs that my kids like very much. You also get six months of access toAmazon Kids+, the company's subscription service that includes tons of age-appropriate books, including lots of books in Spanish, and a two-year warranty. My 7-year-old likes the smaller size of the basic (and cheaper)Kindle Kids ($130), and he also likes the kid-friendly covers better. However, my 9-year-old likes the bigger display on the Kids Paperwhite, which is better for reading graphic novels. I also prefer the Paperwhite over the basic Kindle because it's waterproof, and she reads poolside at her brother's swimming lessons.SpecsDisplay:7 inches, adjustable warm lightResolution:300 PPIStorage:6 GB (Paperwhite)Weight:7.4 ounces (Paperwhite)Battery and charging:Up to 12 weeks, USB-CWaterproof:Yes, IPX8For Heavy Note TakingPhotograph: Nena FarrellreMarkablePaper Pro$679Amazon (with Marker Plus)$579ReMarkable (with Marker)$629ReMarkable (with Marker Plus)We’ve tried a fewE Ink tabletsmeant for taking “handwritten” notes that can be organized and searched digitally. E-readers with that capability still prioritize reading. If the Kobo Libra Colour isn't big enough for your note-taking needs, you might prefer these. Right now, our favorite E Ink tablet is the$579 ReMarkable Paper Pro(7/10, WIRED Review), which lets you take notes with a responsive stylus on a color E Ink screen. However, it's not meant for reading—you can read PDFs on it, but the experience of getting books on it is far from seamless compared to Kobos and Kindles.SpecsDisplay:11.8-inch color displayResolution:229 ppiStorage:64 GBWeight:1.16 poundsBattery and charging:Up to 2 weeks, USB-CWaterproof:NoOther Good Ebook ReadersBelow, you'll find a few more e-readers we like but don't necessarily love as much as our top picks.Kindle ScribePhotograph: Brenda StolyarKindle Scribe 2024 for $400: The Scribe (8/10, WIRED Review) is a great option if you want an e-reader that doubles as a digital notebook, but also want to remain within the Kindle ecosystem. It has a 10.2-inch (300 ppi) paperlike display with features like adjustable warm light and an auto-adjusting front light. The included Premium Pen also has a soft-tipped eraser (mimicking that of a No.2 pencil). With Active Canvas and expandable margins, you can also mark up ebooks and write notes in the side panel.Nook GlowLight 4 Plus for $180: The 4 Plus is the only waterproof Nook in the lineup, and it has the biggest screen at 7.8 inches, along with 32 GB of storage. It also has physical page-turn buttons and a headphone jack for listening to audiobooks (but you can also connect wireless earbuds via Bluetooth). But it was often slower than my Kindle and tended to freeze. While the large library hascheapand evenfreeebooks, it's not as good a selection as Kindle Unlimited. The process of getting a bookfrom the library on a Nookis also beyond frustrating. You'll need to download eitherAdobe Digital EditionsorAndroid File Transferbefore connecting the device to your computer physically and then transferring the files.Kindle ColorsoftPhotograph: Brenda StolyarKindle Colorsoft for $280:The Kindle Colorsoft (7/10, WIRED Review) is Amazon's first Kindle with a color screen. It has a screen with an oxide backplane, which Amazon says delivers better contrast and image quality along with custom-formulated coatings and nitride LEDs for brightness and color accuracy. But the screen is capped at 150 ppi for color images, versus 300 ppi for black and white, and the experience of reading is still a little fuzzier when compared to the latest Paperwhite. It takes noticeably longer to process color images, too. It's missing features that are by now standard on other color e-readers, like page turn buttons and stylus support. It's not abadKindle, and color does enrich the whole e-reading experience, but we suggest waiting for a discount during an Amazon sale event.Kobo Clara Colour for $160:Kobo's Clara Colour seems to be disappearing from retail store, so it's likely that there's a successor on the way (or Kobo is just nixing it). It's a shame because I really like it, especially compared to the Kindle Colorsoft. It's more affordable, but you still get to see book covers or graphic novels in full color, and you can highlight in color too. In testing, I found that some books weren't as easy on the eyes, like the blue-and-yellow color scheme ofCurious George, but that was one small gripe in an otherwise seamless reading experience. The Clara lacks page-turn buttons, but the 6-inch screen size is comfortable for one-handed use. It has 16 gigabytes of storage rather than 32, but that's still about 12,000 books. There's Overdrive integration and Bluetooth support. It's also waterproof, made from recycled materials, and isrepairable.Nook 9-inch Lenovo Tablet for $130:If you mainly read cookbooks or other color-intensive materials, and you want a dedicated reader, you might want to consider this affordable tablet from Nook and Lenovo, which has the Nook app built in (6/10, WIRED Review). As with the tablets mentioned above, you lose the E Ink screen and the distraction-free nature of an e-reader. You can at least turn off notifications while in certain apps, which I recommend doing for the Nook app. It ships with an old version of Android, and it's not built for heavy work like video or photo editing.Power up with unlimited access toWIRED.Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just$2.50$1 per month for 1 year.

To figure out which Mac model you have, click on the Apple icon in the menu bar in the upper-left corner of your display and clickAbout This Mac. We've listed all the models able to run macOS Sequoia below.MacBook Air: 2020 and laterMacBook Pro: 2018 and laterMac Mini: 2018 and lateriMac: 2019 and lateriMac Pro: 2017 and laterMac Pro: 2019 and laterMac Studio: 2022 and laterHow to Install MacOS SequoiaAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronBefore installing the new OS, we highly recommend you back up your Mac first. You can do this bybacking up your fileswith Time Machine or storing your files in iCloud. Apple'ssupport articlehas step-by-step instructions on how to do this.To download the software, click on the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of your screen. Then clickSystem Settings > General > Software Update. Then, click onUpdate Now(orUpgrade Now). From there, click Upgrade Now—your Mac will start to download and install macOS Sequoia.New MacOS Version UpdatesAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWe've listed all the major features in macOS Sequoia below. But throughout the year, Apple will continue to release additional updates that include new capabilities (that weren't included in the initial launch), security patches, and bug fixes. To update your Mac to the latest version, go toSettings>General>Software Updateand follow the instructions above.MacOS 15.5:This update mainly includes bug fixes and security updates. There's also a new feature for Screen Time notifications.MacOS 15.4:This update includes new Mail app features, new emoji, Sketch style for Image Playground, lossless audio for the AirPods Max, and a Quick Start feature.MacOS 15.3:This update includesGenmoji, enhanced notification summaries, temporarilydisabled news app summaries, and a new minor feature on the Calculator app. Apple Intelligence is now enabled by default.MacOS 15.2:This update added Image Playground, ChatGPT support in Siri and Writing Tools, Rewrite prompts in Writing Tools, AirTag shared location tracking in Find My, and minor improvements to the Photos app.MacOS 15.1:This update included iPhone Mirroring, Window Tiling, Text Effects and Emoji Tapbacks in Messages, a redesigned Reader in Safari, Math Notes in the Calculator app, and access to hiking trails in Maps. It also debuted Apple Intelligence features for M-series Macs such as Writing Tools, Smart Replies and Mail Summaries, Clean Up in Photos, Summaries for Transcriptions and Call recordings in Notes, Reduce Interruptions Focus, and the new Siri. (You can type requests and move the Siri window around the screen.)MacOS Sequoia FeaturesBelow, you'll find all the major features included in macOS 15. Apple has moredetails here.iPhone MirroringPhotograph: AppleSometimes, your iPhone is in another room or deep in your bag. For those moments when you need to use it but don't feel like getting up to find it, you can pull it up on your computer. As part of Apple's Continuity features, iPhone Mirroring lets you access and interact with your iPhone wirelessly using your Mac.When the feature is in action, you'll see your iPhone's custom home screen appear. From there, you can use the keyboard, trackpad, or mouse to drag and drop content (like photos, videos, and files) between both devices, open and use any of your apps, swipe through all the pages on your home screen, as well as view and respond to notifications. While you're doing all this, your iPhone will remain locked. It also works while your iPhone is inStandby mode, a feature from iOS 17 that turns your iPhone into a smart display while charging.Safari UpdatesPhotograph: AppleMacOS Sequoia offers a few new features to Safari. With Highlights, Safari will use machine intelligence to show you relevant information from the webpage like directions, links, summaries, and restaurant reviews. Apple also redesigned the Reader to minimize distractions. In addition to a sleeker view of the article, you can also see a summary and a table of contents (for longer articles). If the webpage includes a video, Viewer will bring it to the forefront while still giving you access to playback controls (Picture in Picture included).Window TilingVideo: AppleAnyone who always keeps a ton of browser windows open simultaneously will appreciate the Window Tiling feature that helps organize them for a better viewing experience. When you drag a window to the edge of the screen, macOS will automatically suggest a tiled position on your screen. (It's similar toSnap on Windows.) You can then drop the window into place, arrange multiple windows side by side, or place them in any of the four corners to make room for more apps. For quicker organization, you can use keyboard and menu shortcuts too.Videoconference ToolsPhotograph: AppleIn 2023, Apple added new videoconference tools withmacOS Sonomaincluding Presenter Overlay, Reactions, and various features for the Mac's built-in webcam. In macOS 15, the company is adding a few more. With apps like FaceTime and Zoom, you can access a new presenter preview capability to see what you're about to share before sharing it. Meanwhile, the built-in backgrounds feature allows you to apply system wallpapers, color gradients, or your own photos as a backdrop for video calls. This feature is available on FaceTime and third-party apps like Webex.A New Passwords AppPhotograph: AppleIf you never loved Keychain, now you have a better option: macOS Sequoia comes with a new Passwords app that allows you to access all your passwords (Wi-Fi passwords included), passkeys, and verification codes in one place. It keeps all your Apple devices in sync, runs on Windows machines (using theiCloud for Windowsapp), and supports end-to-end encryption.More With MessagesPhotograph: AppleA few new Messages features are coming to macOS Sequoia—and by extension, to iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 as well. You can format your texts within Messages using bold, italic, underline, and strike-through type treatments. You can also add animated effects to a specific word within a text. For some phrases and words, suggestions appear as you type. Apple added new Tapbacks too—instead of using the traditional heart, thumbs-up, thumbs-down, question mark, or exclamation point, there are options for emojis and stickers. Another standout new feature is the option to schedule your messages ahead of time so they'll be sent later.Other Miscellaneous FeaturesPhotograph: AppleApple Maps:With Maps, you'll have access to thousands of hiking trails across all 63 national parks in the US, all of which can be filtered by elevation, length, and route type. You can also save them to access later in the wilderness without a data signal.Calculator App:Apple gave the Calculator app an upgrade by adding new features like the ability to enter and continue to view complete expressions (with trigonometry, parentheses, and multiple operations) before pressing equals to see the final answer. If you tap the equals sign twice, you can repeat the most recent mathematical function. You're now able to see a history of your calculations as well.Calendar:Within the Calendar app, you can see both events and tasks from the Reminders app. There's also an updated Month View meant to make it easier to see all your appointments at a glance—all of which are color coded.Photos:A new Collections feature within the Photo app will automatically organize your library by topics, including Trips, Recent Days, and People & Pets. With Pinned Collections, you can quickly access certain collections and albums. You can also see your Favorites album appear under Utilities and in Pinned Collections, and clear your Recently Shared album and Recently Viewed history too.Game Mode:This feature was originally announced in 2023 with macOS Sonoma. With macOS Sequoia, Apple improved Game Mode with smoother frame rates and “advanced power management features” to boost performance across its Macs. It also supports Personalized Spatial Audio and reduces audio latency with the AirPods Pro (2nd generation).Home App:Apple is adding guest access that allows you to manage how and when people can enter your house. There's a new feature that shows how much electricity you're using and how much it's costing you, based on the current utility rates.Battery:The ability to turn on Low Power Mode was introduced with macOS Monterey. Now it's available in the Battery menu in the top-left corner of your screen so you no longer have to dig through System Settings.Find My:Within the Find My app, you'll now see a new Lost AirTag section that allows you to share the location of your AirTag with up to five other people, to help track it down. Soon, you can share it with airlines as well (if your luggage is lost). Simply send the specific link via Messages, Notes, Mail, AirDrop, and more. They'll have to authenticate it using their Apple account, and the link will expire after a week.Emoji:Apple added eight new emojis to its library, including root vegetable, leafless tree, fingerprint, face with bags under eyes, harp, a flag of Sark, splatter, and shovel.AirPods Max:The AirPods Max with USB-C now supports lossless audio, so it can support files with a resolution of up to 24 bits/48 kHz. It supports ultra-low latency too, for improved gaming performance, along with upgraded fidelity and response time for songwriting, beat making, and other music production use cases. Plus, these are the only headphones that allow users to record and mix using Personalized Spatial audio with head tracking via Logic Pro for Mac.Quick Start:You can now scan a code on your iPhone or iPad when setting up a new Mac. From there, all your settings will transfer to your computer.Screen Time:When setting Screen Time restrictions on your child's devices, you'll receive a notification when the passcode is used to override it.Apple Intelligence FeaturesPhotograph: AppleIn addition to the features above,Apple Intelligence—the company's “personal intelligence system”—is built into macOS Sequoia as well as iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. These features are only available in Sequoia 15.1 and newer. It's also worth noting that Apple Intelligence is now on by default with Sequoia 15.3. For step-by-step instructions on how to manually turn it off, read ourtutorial here.Apple Intelligence isn't available on all Macs that support macOS 15. You'll need aMac running the M1 chipset or newerto take advantage of the AI newness.

There's Rewrite, which allows you to pick from different versions of what you've written based on several tones (you can also now type instructions for the specific type of rewrite you want); Proofread, which checks word choice, grammar, and sentence structure, while also suggesting edits (along with explanations of the edits) with the option to review or quickly accept; and Summarize, which allows you to select text and have it recapped in a paragraph, list, a table, or bulleted key points. Using the ChatGPT extension, you can also use it tocompose textwith Writing Tools.These text-based features are also what enable Priority notifications—a feature that summarizes your notifications and places them at the top of the list. That way, you can quickly digest them at a glance.Currently, Apple has halted summaries for news apps after itinaccurately summarized a BBC headline. As for other notification summaries, you'll now see them appear italicized.Mail AppThe Mail app comes with a similar Priority notifications feature called Priority messages, which places important emails at the top of your inbox along with summaries of long emails. Messages are also automatically organized into categories, including Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions. With a Digest View, you can also see emails that come from the same email address, and an All Mail view shows you all the categories at once.Image PlaygroundPhotograph: AppleImage Playground generates playful images based on different styles, including Illustration and Animation. Apple recently added a new style called Sketch, which gives images a hand-drawn look. It's available as a dedicated app, but you can also access it through Messages. To generate an image, you can pick from the available concepts, type a description of what you're looking for, or choose a photo of someone from your photo library.Customize Your MemoriesPhotograph: AppleIf you're a fan of the Memories feature in the Photos app, you might be happy to see that Apple has made it more customizable. Rather than settling for the automated version, you can create specific stories you want to see by typing in a description. From there, Apple will pick out the best photos and videos that match the description, create a storyline based on themes associated with the photos, and generate a movie with its own narrative.Apple also introduced a new Clean Up tool. Similar to Google's Magic Eraser, Clean Up can identify and remove unwanted or distracting objects in the background of the photo without changing the subject.Smarter NotesPhotograph: AppleThe Notes app now comes equipped with the ability to transcribe audio sessions and summarize notes. There's also a new Math Notes feature that lets you type in an equation and have it solved automatically within the body of the note.A Better SiriPhotograph: AppleApple finally gave Siri an overhaul. It's been redesigned to speak more naturally, now supports typing, and with a ChatGPT integration, you're more likely to get answers to complex questions.However, Apple also promised the ability for Siri to understand context within conversations. So instead of always having to help Siri along by reminding it of what you were asking about in your last question, Siri will simply remember what the topic of the conversation is and can pull from other sources to find relevant information, like email, calendar, and messages. Apple has not yet delivered on this capability andrecently delayed it.Reduce InterruptionsThere's a new Focus mode called Reduce Interruptions. It uses your personal context to figure out when to hide incoming notifications that could distract you. But if you're worried you might miss something important, you can turn on Intelligent Breakthrough and Silencing, which will send through any critical alerts (like important texts).Photograph: AppleGenmojiThis is one of the most fun features included with macOS 15. Also available on iOS 18/iPadOS 18, it allows you to create custom emojis from your keyboard via text prompts or a person's photo from your Photos app. For instructions on how to create your own, you can read our tutorialhere.",

At heart, the best meal kits are marvels of logistics—a convergence of growers, butchers, purveyors, and saucemakers from all over the country and globe, kitted out into little individual portions and sent to your doorstep with one-sheet recipes. The promise of the internet has always been the world at your door (maybe even economically, if you do it right). This, in part, is why WIRED devotes so much coverage to the best meal prep kits, as well as all manner ofotherdeliveryservices.The WIRED Reviews team has tested and retested more than two dozen meal kits since 2017. For a lot longer, I've worked as a food criticonbothcoasts, and bring a critic's gimlet eye to testing recipes and food. I've frankly been surprised how well the best meal kits fare. My highest-rated meal kit,Marley Spoon(8/10, WIRED Recommends), offers a path to genuinely good home cooking on nights when I might otherwise feel uninspired. Others among our favorite meal kits, likeGreen Chef(8/10, WIRED Recommends) orPurple Carrot(8/10, WIRED Recommends), offer excellent solutions for gluten-free or vegan home cooks to whom restaurants can often be fraught with peril.I assessed each meal plan's recipes, breadth of selection, ingredients, sourcing, ease of preparation, convenience, organization, packaging, high-quality ingredients, and suitability for different eating restrictions and needs. We also tested out the best new meal kits, for those looking for alternatives to Blue Apron or HelloFresh. Here are the best delivery meal subscriptions we've tried.Be sure to check out our investigation into whetherMeal Kits Are Cheaper Than Groceries in 2025and our related guides, includingThe Best Food Gifts You Can Buy Online,The Best Coffee Subscriptions, andThe Best Delivery Chocolate Boxes.Updated May 2025: We ordered and retested every meal kit featured in this guide within the past year, and mostly within the past three months. This included Home Chef, Blue Apron, Marley Spoon, Dinnerly, HelloFresh, Green Chef, EveryPlate, Factor, Purple Carrot, Thistle, Sakara Life, Daily Harvest, Gardencup, and Hungryroot. A previous version of this meal kit guide was prepared by WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe.Best Meal Kit OverallPhotograph: Matthew KorfhagePhotograph: Matthew KorfhagePhotograph: Matthew KorfhageChevronChevronMarley SpoonMeal KitShop atMarley SpoonMarley Spoon (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is not always the simplest meal kit on this list, nor is it the cheapest. But it quite simply offers the bestcookingof any meal kit among the many delivery meal services I've tried, with fresh ingredients and well-sourced proteins and large portion sizes. From a Hungarian-influenced creamy mushroom chicken to a boldly Cajun-spiced tilapia or a delicate eggplant parm, Marley Spoon offers fully-realized, balanced and hearty homestyle meals I was actually excited to make, with sound culinary technique. The lemon sauce on the tilapia might be deglazed with the crispy bits in the pan, adding both depth and balance. A kale and sausage soup, deeply savory, might be balanced with acid from a surprising splash of red wine vinegar. Recipes often call for light seasoning throughout the process, not all at once. With many meal kits, I find myself second-guessing the recipe. Marley Spoon sometimes teaches me a little something.It makes sense the cooking would be good: Marley Spoon is the Martha Stewart meal delivery service. Or at least, when Marley expanded to the United States from Germany, the company partnered with the cooking maven, and adapted techniques and recipes from her repertoire. Marley Spoon recipe developers sign their work with their full names, meaning you can follow authors you like and choose their meals. (I tend to like Kevin Chen's, and Anna Painter's, for what it's worth.) The ingredient sourcing is also thoughtful: Dang if they didn't send meCento brand San Marzano tomatoesfor my eggplant parm, the same thing I would have bought if I'd gone to the store. Which is to say, the recipes and ingredients are each assembled with care, by cooks who put their name on their handiwork. How nice. Just note that, as with most meal delivery services, meal prep times are about 50 percent longer than the recipe advertises. Like most meal plans, Marley Spoon assumes you have oil, butter, salt, and pepper of your own. And there's actual cooking involved, so it's best for those who like doing so.SpecsCost per meal$11 to $13 per serving, plus $12 shipping per boxMeal plan optionsTwo or four people; two to six meals a weekLowest-cost plan at full price$63 a week; two meals for two peopleSize of weekly menu100 choices each weekGluten-free meals?More than half of meals marked “no added gluten”Plant-based meals?Lots of vegetarian; limited veganOther dietary plans“Health boost,” low-calorie, low-carb, pescatarian, 30 minute meals.Typical prep time:30 minutes to an hourBest for Cosmopolitan TastesPhotograph: Hello FreshPhotograph: Matthew KorfhagePhotograph: Matthew KorfhageChevronChevronHelloFreshMeal KitShop atHelloFreshHelloFresh (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is arguably the most successful and best recognized brand in meal kits, active in 18 countries on three continents, with thousands of recipes and four distinct meal kit brands in its portfolio. Perhaps it should then come as no surprise that HelloFresh slips the most comfortably from cuisine to cuisine, of all the meal kits I tried—or that it seemed the most attentive to modern tastes in food. It's also well-organized, with each recipe's ingredients portioned into labeled bags. All you need is pots, pans, a stove, and some basic oil- and salt- and butter-type staples.Alongside excellent sourcing of proteins from multi-generational, family-run meat purveyors, what impressed me most with HelloFresh is that it's evolved into the most cosmopolitan meal kit among those I tried, flipping happily pell-mell among international spices and ingredients (without any particular claim to authenticity, mind you). I didn't find this to be true a few years back, when I found HelloFresh a little staid. But lately the offerings are bright, light, and lightly internationalized: with pan-Latin steak and rice bowls, beef stir-fried with ponzu and plum, Dutch-inspired orange Dijon chicken, Thai-style curries, and maybe some mango salsa atop a vaguely Southwest-y pork roast. HelloFresh is likewise responsible for myfavorite bowl of ramen I've made for myself at home.Which is to say, the menu looks a lot like the broad-ranging eating habits of most people I know. That said, recipes can sometimes skimp on rice portions, and there are a few missteps or miscues here and there in terms of cooking techniques. This aside, HelloFresh offers delicious meals, and remains neck and neck with the top pick, Marley Spoon. In a nice customer-friendly touch, each HelloFresh recipe card has a QR code you can scan to get help if you have trouble with a recipe. I never had such need, but it's nice to know there's backup.SpecsCost per meal$11 to $12.50 per serving, plus $11 shipping per boxMeal plan optionsTwo, four, or six people; two to six meals a weekLowest-cost plan at full price$61 a week; two meals for two peopleSize of weekly menuMore than 100 choices each weekGluten-free meals?Not attested to as such; prepared in shared facilities. (HelloFresh's gluten-free service isGreen Chef.)Plant-based meals?Vegetarian meal plan offered. Relatively few vegan offerings.Other dietary plansKid-friendly, “Fit & Wholesome,” 20-minute meals, pescatarianTypical prep time:20 to 45 minutesBest Budget Meal KitPhotograph: Every PlatePhotograph: Matthew KorfhagePhotograph: Matthew KorfhagePhotograph: Matthew KorfhageChevronChevronEveryPlateMeal KitShop atEveryPlateAt $7 a serving plus shipping, HelloFresh budget option EveryPlate (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is easily the lowest-cost meal kit I've tested—lower even than other budget kits, or the meal kit for toddlers. Is EveryPlate like HelloFresh, but cheaper? In many ways, yes. What's different is not compromise, but simplicity. Recent successes included a lovely spring risotto, layered with shaved parmesan and dappled with still-crisp peas and lightly browned zucchini. I got fresh sprigs of rosemary to accompany a thin-sliced and richly pan-sauced pork loin from a legacy meat purveyor in North Carolina. Each was also fairly hearty, though a bit less than the calorie count from its more sophisticated and more expensive cousin, HelloFresh.So what's the catch? In some ways, there isn't one. EveryPlate's meals cost less because they're simpler, usually relying on a single accent like rosemary or lemon. The laundry list of staples you're expected to have in your fridge is a little longer, and includes flour and eggs. The box of ingredients is not as organized as HelloFresh's. The menu is significantly shorter than HelloFresh at about 35 options, but still longer than the menu from many meal kits. All in all, while the meals skew more basic than adventurous, I came away impressed by the simple good taste and economy on offer from EveryPlate, at a price that would not stretch most household budgets one whit. Sure, you may want to fill out a meal by adding your own rice to supplement Korean-inflected beef, or pork with a squash and carrots. But even with your own rice added, you'll have a quite economical meal, one you might appreciate on a Tuesday when you're out of other ideas.SpecsCost per meal$6 to $7 per serving, plus $11 shipping per weekMeal plan optionsLowest-cost plan at full price$53 a week; three meals for two peopleSize of weekly menuMore than 40 options on snacks, salads, soups, and veggiesGluten-free meals?Yes, aplentyPlant-based meals?Both vegan and vegetarian filtersOther dietary plans/restrictionsOther filters include dairy-free, high protein, no onions, and nut-freePrep time20 to 45 minutesBest Gluten-Free Meal KitPhotograph: Green ChefPhotograph: Matthew KorfhagePhotograph: Matthew KorfhageChevronChevronGreen ChefMeal KitShop atGreen ChefA lot of gluten-free meal kits are a sad parade of gummy tapioca pancakes, sawdusty meatloaf, or limp zoodles: poor substitutes for wheat, on products most often made with wheat. Not Green Chef (8/10, WIRED Recommends). After a week of gluten-free meals from HelloFresh's organic meal-kit brand, I actually didn't find myself missing gluten at all. From unimpeachably trimmed bavette steaks in creamy red pepper sauce, to a sweet-spicy honey-ginger shrimp rice bowl, the gluten-free meals and recipes from Green Chef were consistently among the most delicious I've tried from a meal kit claiming to offer gluten-free food. Heck, I even loved the kale-quinoa salad. The secret to its success is no secret at all: None of the recipes ever needed gluten in the first place. Each was a fully realized meal, with nothing missing and nothing replaced.Note, however, that not all meals from Green Chef are gluten-free. Green Chef is first and foremost the organic arm of HelloFresh. But it also caters to other eating restrictions, with a strong vegetarian and focus nad dairy-free and keto meals also in attendance. But more than half of Green Chef's meals are indeed gluten-free, offering a heartening diversity of options. All of these are prepared in dedicated gluten-free facilities, using gluten-free ingredients that have been traced back to their source, as attested by in-personinspections and validation by Washington state's Gluten Intolerance Group. (Yes, I called up GIG, and verified the stringency of its validation program. Spokespeople there said they've also never received a report of gluten contamination in a Green Chef meal.) Aside from all this, Green Chef's recipes are both simple and well-managed, more unimpeachable in terms of technique than any other kit I've tested by HelloFresh. The recipes are well organized, and pre-portioned into individual bags. The prep times are maybe almost honest, even: I think I may have actually prepared a half-hour meal in a half-hour. That said, Green Chef is more expensive than most, at $12 a serving plus shipping.SpecsCost per meal$12 per serving, plus $11 shipping per weekMeal plan optionsThree or four meals per week; sized for two, four or six peopleLowest-cost plan at full price$83, for three meals for twoSize of weekly menuMore than 40 options, more than half of which gluten-freeGluten-free meals?The last couple weeks we checked had 27 gluten-free optionsPlant-based meals?About a third of dishes are vegetarian. Vegan selection is more limitedOther dietary plans/restrictionsA third of meals are dairy free; a few keto offerings as well. Produce and eggs are organic unless otherwise specifiedPrep time15 to 45 minutesBest Vegan Meal KitPhotograph: Molly HigginsPhotograph: Molly HigginsChevronChevronPurple CarrotMeal KitShop atPurple CarrotOf all the vegan meal kits tested by WIRED vegan meal kit testerMolly Higgins, Purple Carrot (8/10, WIRED Recommends) took the, uh, carrot. Purple Carrot does offer boxes filled with pre-made, frozen, oven-ready meals—with adventurous dishes like mole enchiladas, or an artichoke-stuffed ravioli that needed a little extra seasoning. But where Purple truly shines is with its fresh-made recipes. And unlike some meal kits that make you go hunting through a box, the ingredients for each of Purple's recipes arrive well-organized in individual plastic bags, accompanied by beautifully designed recipe cards.Purple's recipes are devoted to the joy of cooking—sometimes to a fault, in the case of some hour-long recipe preps. (Advertised shorter prep times, as is often the way with meal kit recipes, were bald-faced lies.) Higgins, a natural cook, loved the time spent sautéeing, searing, mixing, and spicing. And especially she loved the results. A lovely Mediterranean rice salad with stuffed grape leaves took just a half hour to make, with some simple oven-roasted radishes, grape tomatoes, and zucchini. The results were a parade of textures, as tasty as one would expect at a restaurant, Higgins wrote, with relatively little effort. But another meal of squash dumplings required both boiling the squash and individually stuffing the dumplings, which took north of an hour. The result was Higgins' favorite meal of the week, a case where effort meets reward. But the effort was nonetheless real. Purple Carrot bursts with texture, flavor, fun international ingredients, and the spirit of invention. If you're the sort who likes to take time in the kitchen, there's vegan gold at the end of that rainbow.SpecsCost per meal$11 to $13.25 per serving, plus $12 shipping per boxMeal plan optionsTwo or four people; three or four meals a week for the classic meal kit. One to ten meals a week, for the ready-to-eat meal plan.Lowest-cost plan at full price$90 to $92 for six meals, including shippingSize of weekly menu25+ meal kit options, and 25 more ready-to-eat optionsGluten-free meals?More than a third of meals are gluten-freePlant-based meals?Vegan, vegan, all-veganOther dietary plans or restrictionsIndividual meals marked as high-protein, low calorie, low sodium, no-nuts, and no-soyPrep time30 minutes to more than an hourBest Family-Friendly Meal KitPhotograph: Home ChefHome ChefMeal KitShop atHome ChefHome Chef (8/10, WIRED Recommends) lets you do pretty much whatever you want. Do you want two servings of two recipes, but eight servings of a third? No problem. Did you want to add an oven-ready steak meal for six to this week's order, and only this week's order? Also no problem. Large family? Home Chef offers a cheaper family plan for batched meals. Only want two meals this week? Each one will cost a little more, but you can still cut back your order without canceling completely.More than any other meal kit I've tested, Home Chef is geared to convenience, and this includes the easy, see-through plastic bags that house the ingredients for each meal. The recipes are finely detailed, with easy-to-follow instructions. Nutrition and allergens are listed in even finer detail online. Each recipe is classed according to difficulty, and even the “expert” ones aren't that hard. It's not for nothing that we previously listed Home Chef as the best meal kit for beginner chefs: Home Chef's recipe instructions are full of little hand-holds and added advice. That said, the meals aren't quite as accomplished and tasty as those you'll get from my top pick, Marley Spoon, nor as varied and interesting as HelloFresh. But convenience, flexibility, and good administration count for a lot in this world. If you've got a family life with ever-changing meal demands from week to week, Home Chef may be precisely the meal kit you need.SpecsCost per meal$10 to $13 per serving, plus $11 shipping per boxMeal plan optionsTwo to eight people; any amount of meals you'd like, in multiple forms, adjustable each week.

So if you're a singleton with a meal kit, you either need to eat heartily or enjoy eating the second half of yesterday's dinner for lunch. But Thistle (8/10, WIRED Recommends) lets you order individual, healthy meals. It's amostlyvegan meal kit—but there's a $3 option to add sustainable meats to any otherwise vegan meal. It's also so local and seasonal that the West and East coasts have different menus, and the whole middle of the country except Chicago gets none (You can check your zip code hereto see if you can get delivery). WIRED reviewer Adrienne So has used Thistle as a means to get herself to eat more vegetables, and thus avoid a life of rickets and/or scurvy. But especially, it's friendly to the solo diner, with individually prepared meals with low to no prep.Portions are generous enough to split among meals, and in a nice turn for those who hate having to dispose of boxes, Thistle's drivers will pick up the cooler bag that housed last week's meal and replace it with a new one full of food. Vegan tester Molly Higgins' favorite meals from Thistle were a whirlwind of textures, including a Mexican-inspired corn and poblano chile salad with adobo pinto beans and a chilled lemongrass-accented rice noodle bowl that mixed spice, tang, crisply fresh veggies, and deep umami from mushrooms and seaweed. She still dreams about it sometimes.SpecsCost per meal$13 for breakfast and $16 for lunch or dinner, plus $5 shipping per boxMeal plan optionsBreakfast, lunch, dinner and desserts all available.

Think of your friend with the silly DoorDash budget who has “no time to cook.” Pretty much everything from Gobble is pre-prepped, whether shredded cheese or even pre-peeled carrots. Recipes might take just 20 minutes to cook—Gobble swears it'll only take 15 minutes—and pots and pans are kept to a minimum. It's food assembly, as much as it's cooking. But note that this means Gobble costs a bit more, and there's a lot of packaging.SpecsCost per meal$12 to $17 per meal, with $7 shippingMeal plan optionsTwo or four servings per meal, two to five nights a weekLowest-cost plan at full price$68; two meals per week for two peopleSize of weekly menu25 to 30 dinner options, plus salads, soups and snacksGluten-free meals?Some gluten-free options availablePlant-based meals?Full vegetarian plan availableOther dietary plans or restrictionsDiners choose among classic, vegetarian, or low-carb “lean and clean” plansPrep time15 to 20 minutes, ideallyBest Ready-to-Eat Meal DeliveryCourtesy of Cook UnityPhotograph: Louryn StrampeChevronChevronCookUnityPrepared MealsShop atCookUnityReady meals are the great and sometimes frustrated promise of the delivery meal service world: fresh food, delivered to your door ready to heat and eat, minus all the effort of actually cooking it. But a lot of ready meals aren't quite what you hope they'd be. Well, CookUnity's ready meals straight up blew WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe's mind when she first tried them in late 2024. The idea is simple. CookUnity's meals all come from actual big-deal chefs, and are cooked in chef hubs that now include New York, Austin, Miami, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Chicago. (See thedelivery mapto check whether your area can get meals.) Many of the chefs behind thse recipes are names you might know, including Cat Cora, Esther Choi, Jose Garces, and soon Rick Bayless.Maybe you'll get a fancy Chicago steakhouse dinner, or maybe an Indian dish from the head of Seattle's chef hub, Gaurav Raj. In Chicago, Strampe delighted in adobo flank steak,rigatoni alla vodka, a Mission-style chicken burrito, and a Mediterranean salmon and quinoa bowl. Each was delicious and fresh, and each included oven or stovetop reheating directions that generally don't take longer than 15 minutes. After reheating, you might also stretch burrata cheese over your pasta, or ladle cumin-forward sauce on your salmon. The meals were filling and the textures were spot-on, quoth Stampe, and the packaging iscompostable and recyclable. Each meal lasts in the fridge between four and seven days from the date of delivery.SpecsCost per meal$11.75 per meal, and $10 shipping.Meal plan optionsChoose anywhere form four to 16 meals a weekLowest-cost plan at full price$57; four meals plus shippingSize of weekly menuVaries, but my hub showed 87 possible mealsGluten-free meals?A majority of meals are listed as gluten-freePlant-based meals?About a fifth of meals are vegetarian or veganOther dietary plans or restrictionsMeal filters include high protein, low carbs, keto, and GLP-1 balancePrep timeA few minutes in the microwave, or maybe 15 minutes in an oven or stovetopBest No-Prep LunchesCourtesy of GardencupPhotograph: Louryn StrampeChevronChevronGardencup Meal SubscriptionShop atGardencupGardencup is a little like having the whole menu of Sweetgreen sent to your house, except in cylindrical form. Basically, you pick out a menu of premade salads, soups, and snacks, and they come in little cups—fresh, lovely, crisp, and ready to eat. Even in winter, wrote WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe (9/10, WIRED Recommends), the produce somehow tastes wonderfully fresh.The tomatoes in the Caprese salad tasted more tomatoey than other tomatoes, somehow. In an Italian pasta salad, the peppers crunched satisfyingly and the greens were great. The snozzberries, presumably, would alsotaste like snozzberries.Some dishes needed a little added seasoning, quoth Strampe, but in general this is among the most low-effort, high reward meal delivery services out there: A fast graze at the nice soup and salad bar, which also happens to be your fridge. The cups are reusable, or they're recyclable. And because it's mostly salad, the meal kit is basically guilt-free.Cost per meal$11 to $13 per serving, plus $11 shipping per weekMeal plan options6-pack or 9-pack, weekly or every two weeksLowest-cost plan at full pricePrices vary, but in general a six-pack plus shipping will start above $70Size of weekly menuMore than 40 options on snacks, salads, soups, and veggiesGluten-free meals?Yes, aplentyPlant-based meals?Both vegan and vegetarian filtersOther dietary plans/restrictionsOther filters include dairy-free, high protein, no onions, and nut-freeTypical prep timeHow long does it take to open a lid and shake up a cup ?More Meal Kits We LikedDinnerly ($6 to $9 per serving):Marley Spoon's lower-cost meal kit, Dinnerly (7/10, WIRED Recommends) was long WIRED's budget pick. Frankly, it's still a good budget pick. It's also a stolidly meat-and-potatoes pick, and often straightforwardly Midwestern in its recipes. The proteins are generous and of excellent quality, and the produce is fresh. The meals are balanced. That said, the recipe development isn't quite up to Marley Spoon standards, though I did love the middle-American trashiness and hold-my-beer inventiveness of a “Reuben meatloaf” stuffed with sauerkraut and caraway seeds. That said, this year I ended up preferring the meals I tried from EveryPlate, which has the further merit of being a buck cheaper a meal.Hungryroot ($10 to $12 per serving):Honestly, I like Hungryroot's model quite a bit (7/10, WIRED Reviewed), and its AI-aided meal planning will probably get even better over time. The plan offers flexibility in mixing upscale grocery shopping with meal kit planning. And it's a little like our top quick-cooking pick,Gobble, in that it often offers somewhat pre-prepped and fast-prepped fare: heating a rice pouch and pan-searing some precooked “chile limon” chicken breast. Add to this a pleasant Southwestern-style black bean and corn salad, plus a squirt of avocado crema, and voilà: a casual lunch. Is Hungryroot better than HelloFresh and other more laborious meal kits? Depends on how much time you have. Fresh-prepped meals generally taste better, but require more effort. In the end, Gobble stayed atop our picks for quick cooking based on its ambitious, interesting flavors.Blue Apron ($8 to $12 per serving, plus shipping):Blue Apron is one of the oldest and most venerable meal kits, and WIRED reviewer Adrienne So has sworn by it as a way to gether picky kids to eat nutritious food.WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe nonetheless experienced a series of unfortunate events when she tested Blue Apron in late 2024 (5/10, WIRED Reviewed), including broken eggs and some unusable food. I didn't have any of these problems when I tried Blue Apron this year, and actually quite enjoyed a recentSichuan-sauced salmon recipe. But I worried about the relative paucity of weekly options compared to other meal kits in Blue Apron's price range. There were only 20 meal kit options, of which multiple were 15-minute recipes with pre-cooked noodles. Add in dietary restrictions or picky eaters, and the options might run thin over time.Nurture Life ($6 to $8 per serving):Nurture Life is like a restaurant kids' menu, in ready-to-eat meal kit form. We loved the idea behind this fresh-made, never frozen delivery meal plan when we tested it a few years back: a bunch of toddler- and slightly bigger kid-friendly meals, from mac and cheese to spaghetti and meatballs to myriad variations on the chicken nugget. The meals are priced about the same as kid menu items, and each contains vegetables alongside the greatest hits.Veestro ($11+ per serving): WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe enjoyed Veestro as a ready-to-eat vegan option, with premade meals delivered fresh, but with freezable options so you can have extra meals on hand in a pinch. The service offers a number of filters for other dietary requirements, and satisfying taste and texture—not always a guarantee on ready-to-eat meals.Sun Basket ($11 to $20 per serving): Like Hungryroot, Sun Basket is a plan that combines meals and groceries into a single service. WIRED Reviewer Louryn Strampe enjoyed Sun Basket's varied meal plans and especially the fresh, organic ingredients—with unblemished, in-season produce that looked as good as what you'd hope to pick up at the store. Other options include extras like coconut yogurt, sous-vide egg bites, soups, and snacks like chocolate nuts and crickets. (Yes, she liked the crickets.) The meal kit also lets you filter out allergen-containing items. Prices vary depending on selections, and it's one of the more expensive kits.Splendid Spoon ($9 to $13 per serving): Splendid Spoon is a nutrition delivery kit that offers a plethora of plant-based smoothies, soups, bowls, noodles, and shots. Everything here is natural, plant-based, and freed of gluten or GMOs, including spaghetti and plant-based \"meatballs.” WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe has a big yen for the smoothies in particular ($10 apiece), but wasn't quite prepared for the intensity of a lemon juice shot that comes as part of a five-pack of dense 3-ounce superfoods.Daily Harvest (prices vary):Daily Harvest (6/10, WIRED Reviewed) is another ready-to-eat meal delivery service specializing in dietary restrictions plant-based, gluten- and dairy-free. Smoothies feature, as do harvest bowls, pastas, and grains. Calories are low. Ingredients are often inventive. The meal's a lifesaver for the solo vegan eater without time to prep a meal, and WIRED vegan reviewer Molly Higgins appreciated that the meals mostly relied on the natural flavors of the vegetables themselves, accented with flavors like curry and lemongrass. As with a lot of frozen meals, however, texture wasn't a strong suit.Factor ($12 to $15 a serving):Factor (6/10, WIRED Reviewed) is a delivery meal plan run by HelloFresh with ready-to-eat meals that look a lot like TV dinners. But there's a twist: They've never been frozen. They were made fresh in a commissary kitchen, and shipped out with cold packs. It's kinda like restaurant leftovers. This means that proteins in particular often maintain their texture quite well, including a chimichurri filet mignon I couldn't believe I microwaved. Some meals, especially carb-avoidant or keto meals, are oddly mushy. But meals centered on proteins and whole starches like potatoes or rice tended to fare quite well. I do wish they'd shed their reliance on the microwave, however: when I went off-script and used a toaster oven or theNinja Crispiair fryer (7/10, WIRED Recommends), I had much better results than with the nuker. Like many ready-to-eat meals, it's a bit more expensive than the kits you cook yourself.Also TriedSakara Life ($28+ per serving), Sakara Life offers plant-based weekly menus in fresh, prepared portions, with greens, flavorful sauces, all-organic ingredients, and textural add-ons like seeds or berries. But it's among the most expensive meal plans we've tested, and neither WIRED reviewer who tried it has really cottoned to the thing. Tester Louryn Strampe questioned the science on health claimsfor detoxes and cleanses, while calling Sakara “egregiously expensive” and full of “bitter veggies and tart fruits.” Vegan tester Molly Higgins, meanwhile, said Sakara Life's tinctures and metabolism supplements didn't agree with her system, and that the mostly raw-food plan made her long for “human food.”Diet-to-Go ($10 to $13 per serving, plus shipping):Diet-to-Go (6/10, WIRED Reviewed) predates the modern meal kit. Founded more than 30 years ago in Virginia, it's a diet plan much in the tradition of Jenny Craig, offering low-calorie microwaveable meals meant to act as total meal replacement. Keto and diabetes-friendly options exist, though the most popular “Balance” plan is geared toward weight loss, with calories limited to 1,600 a day for men and a mere 1,200 for women. Anyway, as is often true with microwaved meals that may or may not arrive frozen (it depends on the season, and where you are), proteins and starches fared better than veggies, which tended to be limp and soggy. Meals were healthy, but not always flavorful, and there were a few real misses.Are Meal Prep Kits Worth It?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronIf you're talking raw materials by the pound—meat, zucchini, rice, noodles—meal kits will of course cost more than buying food at grocery stores. It's a service, after all, with added value above simple ingredient cost. Unless you've got quite expensive taste, you'll easily be able to make meals at home for less than the $7 to $14 a serving that a meal kit will cost. But this said, this doesn't necessarily mean that meal kits are expensive for what they offer. I conducted an experiment, trying to re-create four different meal kit meals by going to my local grocery store–buying every ingredient provided by the meal kit. Turns out, if you don't have the right sauces and spices at home already, it'svery difficult to recreate these meals at grocery stores for less than they cost from a meal kit, in part because you'll most likely have to buy full containers of sauces and spice.So, is HelloFresh worth it compared to a grocery store? Caveats are in order: For staple ingredients and spices you'll use on multiple recipes, the grocery store is of course cheaper. Once you buy a container of paprika for an individual recipe, it'll also be there for future recipes, whereas meal kit spices are portioned for the meal. So the real answer is that meal kits can be a quite economical way of trying out a new recipe, or a new style of cooking, without larding up your fridge with condiments you won't use again. For ingredients you'd use less commonly, a meal kit can reduce waste and spoilage, and maybe even compete on price for an individual meal.If your comparison point is takeout, well, the best meal delivery services on this list are will almost certainly be cheaper and more nutritious. I've found that a meal kit in the fridge tends to be a good motivator to cook a nutritive meal—and thus can save me both the money and the cholesterol.To really save on cost, some people like to keep testing out the trial offers and discounts. Much likemattress-in-a-boxcompanies, meal kit companies usually have a running promotion. Usually this takes the form of a trial discount price that'll drop your cost by half or more during the first week or two, in hopes you'll like the service enough you keep it on at full price.For me, a meal kit a few times a week ends up balancing out well: It's a motivating factor to eat better, and it means that when I do go to the grocery store, I can do so less mindlessly and more purposefully, since I've always got a few meals' worth of ingredients in the fridge. It's also had the side effect of broadening my culinary toolkit, keeping me from getting stuck in the same ruts.That said, you know: It's a set grocery expense and not necessarily a small one. I do get tired of tossing or recycling cold packs and boxes. And depending on time of year, I often prefer shopping in person for what's seasonal and local, when produce is at its peak—an experience you don't get from a meal kit,or from grocery delivery for that matter.If you're cooking for a bigger household, meal kits can also lose their utility quite quickly. A convenient option for two can become a much larger expense for a family of four or six.What If I Take a Trip Out of Town?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronPretty much every meal kit I've tested has an option to pause subscriptions—and there's no particular limit to how often you can do this. The main thing is to be sure that you've canceled with enough lead time. Some services let you cancel or pause delivery as late as the Friday before a Monday delivery. HelloFresh requires five days' notice. Some, like Hungryroot, may lock in next week's order as early as the previous Monday, depending on where you live. Read your terms of service, and act accordingly.Tips for Using Meal KitsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronDon't order too many meals per week:You know the old John Lennon line: Life is what happens when you're busy out eating a random burrito, then thinking guiltily about the meal kit at home in your fridge. Aspirations are great, but don't order more meals than you're likely to make, or you'll be sad. Err on the side of caution. Order just enough meals per week that making yourself a recipe from your HelloFresh or Home Chef box is still a delight and a convenience and an overall boon to your life—not an obligation. For me, a somewhat improvisational and impulsive person, three meals a week is the sweet spot.Make room in your fridge:Meal kits take the place of a lot of grocery shopping. But they're also a lot of food, and a lot to keep organized. What I like to do is clear a tall enough space in my fridge to put the whole meal kit box in the fridge, after pulling out the cold packs: This way, I'm not left worrying about which groceries belong to the meal kit, and I won't lose any ingredients. I can just pull the whole box out when I want to make a meal. That said, some plans like Home Chef, Hello Fresh, and Green Chef are very good at organizing each meal into its own separate bag. An added bonus from these more organized plans is that you'll be able to use less space in your fridge. Over time, this will matter.Check the recipe cards to make sure you have everything you need to make a recipe:Most meal kits expect that you'll have certain staple ingredients in your home, usually including oil and butter. Recipes also have requirements for cookware. Check this before you start a recipe. Nothing worse than realizing you need an absentee stick of butter on step 5, with carrots already browning in the toaster oven.Remember, you owe nothing to the recipe:Meal kit services hire lovely recipe developers, of course. And on the best meal kits, these chefs have spent a lot of time optimizing each recipe. But you owe them nothing—nothing! Add spices, change steps, season food when you want to season it. Meal kits can teach you a lot about how to make a good meal, and shake you out of tired culinary routines. But it's your meal. Make it how you like. Have fun.Power up with unlimited access toWIRED.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.Apple executives alwaysdescribe new hardware and software as the “best” or “biggest” ever, but the delivery doesn’t usually live up to the hype (seelast year's iPads). However, iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 might be deserving of a few of those adjectives. The latest version of the operating system has the usual degree of year-over-year quality-of-life improvements, butApple Intelligencesteals the limelight.This is Apple's implementation of artificial-intelligence-powered tasks that have beensweeping through the tech industryover the past few years. Even Siri got an upgrade, though we're still waiting for many of thepromised features to arrive. Here are all the new iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 features, how to download the current version, and what exactly you’ll experience with Apple Intelligence.Table of ContentsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWhat Is Apple Intelligence?Top iOS 18 FeaturesTop iPadOS 18 FeaturesUpdated May 2025: We've added details about iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5.Is Your iPhone or iPad Compatible?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronGood news! Every iPhone that was capable of installingiOS 17can run iOS 18. Apple did not drop any iPhones from the list of supported devices. If you have the iPhone XR and iPhone XS from 2018 or newer (including thesecond-andthird-gen iPhone SE), you can download and run iOS 18. If you're unsure what model iPhone you have, head to the Settings app, tap onGeneral>Aboutand look at theModel Name. This doesn't mean every feature is available, as some require more modern processors. (Apple Intelligence, for example, isexclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro andiPhone 16models; more on this below.)It’s a little more complicated for iPads, since the naming scheme depends on the hardware generation rather than specific device names. Here are the generations that support iPadOS 18 (unlike iPhones, some iPads are no longer supported). You can figure out which model you have byfollowing the directions here.iPad: 7th gen and lateriPad Mini: 5th gen and lateriPad Air: 3rd gen and later (including M2 and M3)iPad Pro 11-inch: 1st gen and lateriPad Pro 12.9-inch:3rd gen and later (including M4)Check out ourBest iPhonesandBest iPadsguides to learn more about current models.How to Install iOS 18AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronBefore installing the new operating system, Ihighlyrecommend you back up your devices. You can do this via iCloud—go toSettings, tap on your name at the top, and selectiCloud. Then, tap oniCloud Backup, toggle it on, and tapBack Up Nowto start a new backup. On the previous iCloud page, you also have the option to toggle off certain apps that you don't want to include in the backup. Don't have enough iCloud storage, or want to use another method? Check out ourHow to Back Up Your iPhone or iPadguide for alternative options.Once you've backed up, you're ready to install iOS 18. Since this is a hefty update, you should plug your devices into a charger and ensure they're connected to Wi-Fi before the update starts. Now go toSettings > General > Software Update. You'll see the option to download the update. TapDownload and Installand, when the download is done, tapInstall Nowto start the update. You’ll know the update is complete when your device restarts.New iOS/iPadOS 18 Version UpdatesAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronAll the top features in iOS and iPadOS 18 are highlighted below, but Apple continues to release additional updates throughout the year. These include new features unavailable at launch, bug fixes, and security patches. To update your iPhone, go toSettings>General>Software Updateand follow the instructions above.iOS/iPadOS 18.5:This update includes support for satellite features on all iPhone 13 models, Screen Time passcode notifications, “Buy with iPhone” on the Apple TV app via a third-party device, andCarPlay Ultra(starting with Aston Martin vehicles).iOS/iPadOS 18.4:This updateincludes Priority Notifications within Apple Intelligence, Visual Intelligence for the iPhone 15 Pro, a stand-alone Vision Pro app, new Emoji, Sketch mode in Image Playground, recipes in Apple News+, new organization features in the Photos app, preauthorized payments in Apple Wallet, lossless audio with AirPods Max, and access to Apple Intelligence features in the Control Center.iOS/iPadOS 18.3:This update includes improved notification summaries, upgrades to Visual Intelligence for iPhone 16 models, and a minor feature added to the Calculator app. Apple Intelligence is now enabled by default (though youcan turn it off).iOS/iPadOS 18.2:This update broughtGenmoji, Image Playground, Image Wand, ChatGPT in Siri, Visual Intelligence, AirTag shared location tracking in Find My, new Mail app features, and new settings for Camera Control. Also, Writing Tools gets a lift from ChatGPT too, with the ability to compose messages. There's no need to join a waitlist anymore to take advantage of Apple Intelligence.iOS/iPadOS 18.1:Apple officially released Apple Intelligence in this version. Originally, you had to head toSettings > Apple Intelligence & Siri > Join the Waitlistto sign up. The waiting list took a few hours; Apple said it was to ensure there's sufficient server capacity. Apple Intelligence launched with the following smart features: Writing Tools, Memory Movies and Clean Up in Apple Photos, Priority Messages in Mail, Smart Reply in Messages, Summaries for Transcriptions and Call recordings in Notes, Notification Summaries, and the new Reduce Interruptions Focus.What Is Apple Intelligence?Siri is getting an AI boost.Photograph: AppleEvery major tech company has been integrating artificial intelligence into its hardware and software, fromGoogleandSamsungtoMicrosoft.Apple Intelligenceis Apple's version, and it's the term you'll see the company throw around over the next few years; it powers many of the new AI features in its devices.It's powered by Apple's large language models (partly trained throughdata from the public web, according to Axios’ Ina Fried). It requires Apple silicon, the company's bespoke chips that have a hybrid architecture designed to run AI tasks. Even though the devices Apple Intelligence runs on are capable of the on-device processing needed to complete AI tasks, sometimes the task is too big and needs to be sent off to the cloud. When a task requires more processing, it'll be sent to a secure data center stacked with computers that also run Apple silicon. While this method of computing is typically less private, Apple claims that itsPrivate Cloud Compute platformfocuses on ensuring data privacy for each user. Only data relevant to your query is sent to these servers, and the data is only used for your requests and never stored.Apple Intelligence Compatible DevicesBefore you get too excited, Apple Intelligence is not available forevery device that supports iOS 18.It's only supported on select processors (and languages).iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max (A17 Pro)iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus (A18)iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max (A18 Pro)iPhone 16e (A18)iPad Mini (A17 Pro)iPad Air (M1,M2,M3)iPad Pro (M1,M2,M4)MacBook Air (M1andnewer)MacBook Pro (M1 andnewer)iMac (M1and newer)Mac Mini (M1andnewer)Mac Studio (M1 Maxandnewer)Mac Pro (M2 Ultra)What exactly is Apple Intelligence? Apple breaks down its key capabilities into three buckets: Language, Images, and Action.Apple Intelligence: LanguageThe new Apple Intelligence Writing ToolsPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuThroughout Apple's hardware and software, you'll find new writing tools that draw on the power of generative AI to assist your writing. This includes Rewrite, which can help change the tone of your text to sound more friendly or more professional (like in an email), and Proofread, which more or less does what the name suggests. You can also summarize selected text with a tap.These text-based improvements go beyond writing. It also powers Priority notifications, which appear at the top of your notification list and summarize it so you get a more digestible summary at a glance. You can turn the feature on by going toSettings > Notifications> Prioritize Notifications. Similarly, the Mail app offers Priority messages, which means important emails will float to the top of your inbox. You can also get summaries of long emails, and a Smart Reply function lets you quickly respond to emails (even answers to multiple questions posed in an email), not unlike what'savailable in Gmail.For now, however, Apple haspaused notification summariesfor news apps following multiple instances where the featurefailed to summarizearticles accurately. Notifications summarized by Apple Intelligence will now appear as italicized text.Apple Intelligence can read your notifications and offer quick summaries of what's inside.Photograph: AppleIn the Notes, Voice Memos, and Phone app, you can hit the record button (yes, even on a call) to get an audio recording with a transcript, and Apple Intelligence can create a summary of that transcript. Apple says that in states that require two-party consent for recordings, the person on the other end of the line will be made aware that the call is being recorded.Finally, there's anew Focusmode called Reduce Interruptions that can understand your personal context, so while it hides incoming stuff that could distract you, it knows enough about what you've got going on to allow a text from your babysitter to come through.Apple Intelligence: ImagesThe Apple Intelligence image features largely revolve around generating new images through artificial intelligence. Much of this happens in Image Playground, an experience baked into other apps (though it also exists as a stand-alone app). You can generate images based on a description, suggested concepts, and even from people in your Photos library. You have control over the style, and it can be tweaked to match whatever's happening in the app you're using it in. You can also choose between different styles, including Illustration, Animation, and (most recently) Sketch, which gives images a more natural, hand-drawn look.Welcome to Genmoji.Photograph: AppleGenmoji just might be the most anticipated feature out of everything Apple has announced. It lets yougenerate emojis directly from the keyboardwith text prompts. You can also pull a person's photo from your Photos library to make an emoji based on their looks. You'll have to provide a description first, but then you can adjust the description until it suits what you are going for.Image Wand is another image generation system that works specifically in the Notes app. With your finger or Apple Pencil, you can circle a sketch to have Apple Intelligence create something that looks more refined, but you can also circle a space, and it will generate an image based on the surrounding text. It's an easy way to add more visual variety to your notes.Beach clean-up.Video: AppleThe Photos app is getting a few AI features. You can make a Memory Movie by entering a description like “All the desserts I ate during the summer last year, set to a pop song,” and Apple's AI will find the right images and video, put them to a song, and craft a shareable movie out of it. It'll also be easier to search for specific photos—just describe what you want and it'll find it, even moments in video clips (similar to Google'sAsk Photos feature). Lastly, you can erase unwanted objects in the background of your photos with the new Clean Up tool in the photo editor, exactly likeMagic Eraser on Pixel phonesandSamsung's Object Eraser.Apple Intelligence: ActionThe final part of Apple Intelligence is arguably one that might be used the most often, and it involves Siri. The assistant has a new look—when activated, the edges of the screen will glow—and you can now type your requests to Siri instead of using your voice (something you've been able to do with Google Assistant for several years).Photograph: Julian ChokkattuThe idea is you'll be able to speak more naturally with Siri, and the assistant will be able to understand context better than ever before. You can say, “Play the podcast my wife sent me the other day,” and Siri will be able to pull it up. However, this kind of personal context isn't yet available—Apple delayed the Siri upgrade,citing that the capabilityis “taking longer than we thought.”Siri can also help explain how to do certain functions on your phone if you're not sure (maybe Samsung wasonto something with Bixby). And if you make a mistake mid-sentence, there's no need to start over again. Siri will be able to understand your slipup, and it remembers the context of your previous query, so you won't need to repeat things.Much like howGoogle's Gemini is drawing on contextbased on what's happening on the screen, Siri can now understand what is on the screen when you activate it, so if someone texts you an address, you can activate Siri and ask it to add the address to the person's contact card. All of this is expected to work in first- and third-party apps.ChatGPT Integration and Visual IntelligenceVisual IntelligencePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuApple Intelligence still needs a boost on some occasions, so Apple has tapped OpenAI's ChatGPT to power Siri. The company says it's using theGPT-4o model, and you are in control of when Siri uses ChatGPT. This powers features such as when you ask about the subject of a photo or a document (like scanning a hundred-page PDF), and Compose, which lets you generate original images and text from a query. All of these GPT features are free with no account required, though if you already are a subscriber, you can link your account and access paid features.Then there's Apple's version ofGoogle Lens, dubbed Visual Intelligence. This is where the new Camera Control button comes into play on the iPhone 16 range. Press and hold it, and it will open the camera viewfinder, but instead of taking a photo, you can “Ask” ChatGPT to explain what you're looking at or search it through Google. You can use this to figure out who that actor is on a movie poster, find out the type of flower in front of you, or glean more information about a landmark. You can also use the feature to add a Calendar event when scanning a flyer. With iOS 18.4, Apple expanded Visual Intelligence to the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. You can trigger it through the Action Button or the Control Center, just like on theiPhone 16e.Top iOS 18 FeaturesOK, onto the more traditional software features. I've collected the top features in iOS 18 below, but there are tons of smaller changes. You can view the full listdirectly from Apple.Get Rid of the App GridCustomize the app icons' style, color, and arrangement.Photograph: AppleFor the first time, you can arrange your apps and widgets however you'd like (just like on Android). Say goodbye to the fixed list of grids Apple has forced on us for nearly two decades. You can make further personalization to the app icons as well, tuning them to a specific color to match or complement your wallpaper, and even convert them to dark mode. You can make these apps and widgets look larger too.More Control in the Control CenterControl Center.Photograph: AppleNew styles.Photograph: AppleControl Center, the hub that appears when you swipe down on the right edge of the iPhone, is now more customizable. There are now tabs within the Control Center, and you can scroll through them with one continuous swipe on the home screen. These include your favorites—the most important things you want accessible in the Control Center—media playback and even smart home controls.You can customize the size and layout of everything in Control Center, and this extends to the lock screen controls—you can switch out the two icons at the bottom of your iPhone's lock screen to something more helpful. Expect new controls from third-party apps.Lock and Hide AppsShhh! Hide apps you don't want others to see that you have installed.Photograph: AppleYou can finally hide apps to prevent anyone from snooping, or you can lock the app so that it asks for a passcode or biometric authentication every time it's launched. The information from this app will be hidden throughout the system, even in notifications and searches. Google debuted a similar newfeature called Private Space in Android 15.Redesigned Photos AppPhotos gets an organizational overhaul.Photograph: AppleApple's Photos app got a huge redesign in iOS 18. Now, you have a photo grid at the top, and below, you can swipe through different collections, such as Recent Days, Trips, and People & Pets. This upgrade is tied with several other improvements powered by Apple Intelligence, like Clean Up, which can erase unwanted objects in the background of your photos, and the ability to find any image easily via search.Apple also added more organizational features. You can filter collections by oldest to newest, sort albums by Date Modified, disable “Recently Viewed” and “Recently Shared” collections, reorder items in the Utilities and Media types collections, and also show or hide items in the Library View that are not in a specific album or that are synced from a Mac or PC.RCS and Satellite MessagingArguably, one of the most anticipated announcements from Apple ended up as a tiny footnote amid the company's announcements. RCS isRich Communication Services, the texting standard that followed SMS/MMS. Android phones have supported RCS for several years, allowing for an upgraded texting experience that pulls features from instant messaging apps, like typing indicators, read receipts, and improved photo and video quality. However, none of this works when an Android user texts an iPhone (or vice versa) because Apple didn't support RCS and used the older SMS standard.That's changing now, “RCS messages bring richer media and deliver and read receipts for those who don't use iMessage,\" according to Apple's marketing materials. These texts will still appear green (instead of blue when you text fellow iPhone owners via iMessage), but it might finally spell the end of thebroken texting experiencethat has causedso many people strife.Photograph: AppleIf you have an iPhone 13 or newer, you can take advantage of texting via satellite when you don't have Wi-Fi or a cellular connection (like when you're on a plane). Apple says all of these iMessages sent via satellite are end-to-end encrypted.The Messages app itself is getting a few new perks too. You can add animated effects to any letter, word, or phrase—these are suggested as you type. And Apple's Tapback feature (emoji reactions) now works with any emoji or sticker. Most importantly, you can now schedule texts and send them at a specific time, a standard texting feature available in most messaging apps.A Password AppPhotograph: AppleIt might be time to say goodbye to yourpassword manager—at least, Apple would be thrilled if you did. The company's new native Passwords app supports end-to-end encryption and is about to becometheway to find your passwords and ID verification codes on Apple devices. This app will work across all of Apple's hardware and even Windows (via the iCloud for Windows app). If you enable AutoFill, Apple says your passwords will automatically populate in the app.iPhone MirroringPhotograph: AppleThis is technically a feature inmacOS Sequoia, but you can access your iPhone's screen via the iPhone Mirroring app in the macOS Dock. You can completely use your Mac keyboard and trackpad to interact with the iPhone, and even have audio from it play onto your Mac's speakers. It supports drag and drop, so you can pull files from your virtual iPhone screen into your Mac. If you have an iPhone-specific notification, click on it from your Mac, and it will launch your mirrored iPhone, allowing you to act on it without having to pick up your device. During all of this, your iPhone stays locked.Top iPadOS 18 FeaturesIt's worth noting many of these iPad features are also available on iOS 18 and vice versa: Almost all the iOS 18 features above are also available on your iPad. Sadly, not much in iPadOS 18 makes theiPad more like a computer, but many of these additions are much appreciated.Smart ScriptVideo: AppleNow you don't have to feel bad about your chicken-scratch handwriting. Apple's Smart Script “re-creates” your handwriting, so you can scribble down as fast as you can, and the system will refine it to be more legible. It can do all of this while apparently still keeping your handwriting style intact. Also, if you paste typed text into a note that's been handwritten, it'll be converted to your handwriting. You can also scratch off text to erase it.The Calculator AppVideo: AppleThe Calculator app is now finally available on the iPad, though it's far from basic. Apple has introduced a feature called Math Notes with Apple Pencil. This lets you write equations, and the app will compute and solve them as soon as you draw an equals sign. It can perform all the same functions as a scientific calculator. You can tap the equals sign twice to repeat the most recent mathematical function.Other New Features Worth NotingActivation Lock for iPhone Parts:Activation Lock prevents someone from activating an erased iPhone if the previous owner did not remove their Apple account password before resetting the device. This feature has been in iOS for a long time, but now it extends to iPhone parts. The idea is to deter thieves from stealing an iPhone for parts, but itcould have disastrous results.Mail:The Mail app now looks more like Gmail, with new tabs that sort your email by Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions. There's also a new “Digest\" view where all emails from the same sender are organized into one area.Safari Highlights:This feature gives you the at-a-glance info you might be looking for on a page. If you're looking for contact or address details on a hotel's webpage, Highlights will surface, so you spend less time clicking on different tabs trying to find it. Also, Safari's Reader mode will now show a table of contents and summary.Apple Maps:Maps now shows topographic maps with trail networks and hikes (US National Parks included). You can save these to your device for offline use and create your own hikes.Apple Wallet:You can now send cash from person to person by tapping two iPhones together (or just bringing them within an inch of each other). You'll no longer need to share phone numbers or email addresses to send somebody $5 for an oat milk cappuccino. With a new “Preauthorized Payments” section, you can also see upcoming payments for your active subscriptions and recurring bills.Game Mode:A common feature on most Android phones, Apple's Game Mode hails from its MacBooks. Turn it on while gaming on an iPhone, and it will minimize background activity to boost frame rates. It also reduces audio latency with AirPods and input lag from wireless controllers.AirPods Pro:Voice Isolation on the AirPods Pro improves your voice quality by eliminating background noise and wind. There are also hands-free Siri interactions (only on the second-gen AirPods Pro and AirPods 4), which let you nod yes or shake your head no to respond to Siri. This lets you accept or reject incoming calls without using your hands or your voice—neat. But be sure to set the 85-dB limit on your AirPods via the audio settings.AirPods Max:Apple's noise-canceling headphones now support lossless audio, with the ability to support audio files with a resolution of up to 24-bit/48 kHz. It also supports “ultra-low latency” (which the company says will improve their gaming performance) along with upgraded fidelity and response time for music production.Notes:The Notes app now lets you generate live audio transcriptions that are searchable. The app also supports collapsible section headers and highlights text with colors.Apple TV:A new feature called InSight in the Apple TV app lets you learn a bit more about who is on the screen, and even get more details on the music playing. You can also now make purchases on the app using non-Apple devices with your Apple ID. (You'll have to confirm the purchase using your iPhone.)SharePlay:You can remotely control someone else's screen via SharePlay, or draw on their screen to show them how to do something.Accessibility:Apple has an eye-tracking mode available on iPhones and iPads, and it lets people control the iPhone or iPad with their eyes.Camera:If you have an iPhone 16 model, you can now use the Camera Control button to switch to the front-facing camera. Anyone with the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max can access spatial photo capture (in addition to spatial video capture). This feature is already available on the iPhone 16 lineup. You can also lock auto exposure and autofocus settings. There's now a Require Screen On feature that will only launch the Camera app via the Camera Control button when the display is on.Find My:In the Find My app, there’s a new Lost AirTag section that lets you share the location of your AirTag with others (up to five people total) to help track it down (you'll soon be able to share it with airlines too, in the event your luggage is lost). You can send out a specific link via Messages, Mail, Notes, and AirDrop, among other apps, that others will have to authenticate before using via their Apple account. The link will expire after a week.Vision Pro:If you have a Vision Pro, you'll have access to anew stand-alone appon your iPhone. When you're not using the headset, you can use it to browse and download content, including apps and games, as well as add TV shows and movies to your watch list.Emoji:Apple added eight new emojis to the collection, including splatter, root vegetable, leafless tree, face with bags under eyes, fingerprint, harp, shovel, and a flag of Sark.Apple News+:If you subscribe to News+, you'll see a new Food section that includes stories about restaurants, healthy eating, and more, along with a Recipe Catalog where you can browse through options and save them to a Saved Recipes section.Screen Time:If you're a parent who has implemented Screen Time restrictions on your child's phone, you'll now receive a notification when the passcode is used to override the feature.CarPlay:Apple is rolling out the next-generation version of CarPlay, starting with Aston Martin vehicles. Known as CarPlay Ultra, the software extends from the main infotainment screen to the instrument cluster for a more consistent look and feel. You can read more about ithere.",

Getting some tension out of your shoulders should be as accessible as your morning coffee. After all, between work, workouts, and the existential crisis that is life, whoisn'tcarrying muscle tension somewhere? I've dedicated countless hours to trying (almost) every type of massage tool out there. Testing these contraptions might sound like the dream gig, but it's not all bliss. Some felt like having a personal therapist at my disposal. Others like they were designed to tenderize meat. A few even led me to question the very choices that brought me to this moment.The good news? I've rounded up the best massagers for all bodies and budgets. These options deliver on their promises to soothe, stimulate, and shiatsu. For more wellness recommendations, read our guides to theBest Theraguns and Therabody Tools,Best Posture Correctors, andEverything You Need for Your Yoga Practice.How We TestedAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronI spent eight months (and counting) testing dozens of massagers across a variety of categories, including (but not limited to) percussive therapy guns, foot massagers, and compression goggles.To assess performance in everyday situations, I incorporated them into regular routines: post-workout recovery, desk-bound workdays, and nighttime wind-downs. I evaluated each device based on build quality, ease of use, and overall value. This involved checking motor strength and consistency, battery life (if applicable), the functionality of extra features, and how effectively each massager targets specific muscle groups. I also considered individual body types and sensitivities.Lastly, I prioritized long-term reliability and customer support. This meant reviewing warranty policies, user reviews, and brand transparency.Next UpAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronI'm testing theChirp Contour Decompression Table for $650and theChirp Halo Wireless Muscle Stim (Double) for $200.Best Massage GunPhotograph: HypericeHypericeHypervolt 2$229Amazon$199$174HypericeMassage guns provide percussion therapy that enhances blood circulation, alleviates muscle fatigue, and minimizes soreness after workouts or tiring days. I recommend the Hypervolt 2 to everyone who isn't an athlete; if you are, it's worth investing in theTheragun Pro Plus ($625). However, the Hypervolt 2 is much more affordable, weighs just 1.8 pounds, and offers ample power thanks to its brushless 60-watt motor. It features three speed settings and five massage heads (flat, bullet, fork, ball, and cushion) to address different muscle groups. It can connect to the Hyperice app via Bluetooth for guided routines, provides up to three hours of battery life, and is TSA-approved for carry-on.TheTheragun Mini ($149)is my favorite mini massage gun. For more Theraguns and percussive massage devices, check out our guides to theBest Therabody ToolsandBest Massage Guns.SpecsBattery Life~3 hoursReturn Policy30 daysWarranty Info1 yearBest Eye MassagerPhotograph: TherabodyTherabodySmartGoggles (2nd Generation)$220TherabodyEye massagers are well-liked for improving blood circulation around the eyes and reducing fatigue caused by long work hours. Therabody’s second-generation SmartGoggles provides an ideal solution for weary eyes and headaches.According to the company’s study, participants averaged 4 percent more sleep when using them before bedtime, 10 percent reported better sleep, and overall, users noted improved sleep quality. Additionally, 82 percent of users felt less stressed, and 71 percent reported lower anxiety levels.These goggles are a step up from the original model (9/10, WIRED Recommends) and maintain the same three settings: Focus, Sleep, and SmartRelax. The heating feature also encourages tear production, offering relief for dry eyes. Compatible with the Therabody app, users can select specific sessions while enjoying calming ambient soundscapes. I often find myself dozing off during a 20-minute session. Though I don’t often suffer from migraines, they would make for an effective blackout sanctuary in a quiet, dark space.SpecsBattery Life~3 hoursReturn Policy30 daysWarranty Info1 yearBest for CalvesPhotograph: HypericeHypericeNormatec Go$399$379Amazon$349Walmart$379Best Buy$379HypericeNormatec Go is a portable version of Hyperice’s air compression system. Whether you’re a frequent traveler or a dedicated runner, the Normatec Go effectively reduces inflammation and blood lactate levels without requiring a full suit. It is ideal for athletes, individuals experiencing poor circulation, and those suffering from chronic pain. These calf-specific sleeves eliminate hoses and control hubs, offering a mobile solution you can wear while cooking or standing at your desk. Each wrap provides 360-degree dynamic air compression to your calves, utilizing Hyperice’s zone-based pulsing to enhance blood flow. With three overlapping compression zones and seven intensity levels, the Go also connects via Bluetooth to the Hyperice app.TheNormatec Elite ($1,099)are Hyperice’s premium full-length compression boots; we haven’t tested them, but they are a luxe choice if you’re considering full-leg coverage.SpecsBattery Life~3 hoursReturn Policy30 daysWarranty Info1 yearBest Portable MassagerPhotograph: ChirpChirpRPM Mini$150Amazon$150$127ChirpThe Chirp RPM Mini is a handheld massager that combines rolling and percussive therapy. It's essentially like an electric rolling pin for your entire body, featuring three speed settings and a multi-grip handle. This cordless device is equipped with six free-spinning massage heads, 24 massage nodes, and nonabrasive rollers that won't pinch your skin. While it's effective for the whole body, I particularly enjoy using it on my calves, biceps, forearms, and palms. I find it to be gentler and more soothing on my smaller muscle groups compared topercussive guns.The battery life is impressive as well, lasting up to four hours on a single charge. I don’t think it justifies the price tag of $150—but it’s TSA-approved for carry-on and comes with a portable case.SpecsBattery Life~4 hoursReturn Policy30 daysWarranty Info1 yearBudget Body MassagerPhotograph: Bob and BradBob and BradEZBack Massager Plus Remote$70$60Amazon$70WalmartBob and Brad's EZBack Massager is a back massager but also a neck massager, a shoulder massager, and even a lower body massager with a little bit of imagination. It has four kneading nodes with bidirectional movement that mimics a shiatsu massage, three intensity settings, and a heat therapy option that feels nice but probably doesn't do much for your sore muscles. It straps to youroffice chairfor a more ergonomic massage experience, uses a remote control, and is designed with a 15-minute auto shut-off to prevent overheating. You can also omit the straps if you’d like to use them while lounging on the couch, but you’ll need to sit near a plug, unfortunately.A cordless versionis available, but I have not tested it.SpecsBattery LifeN/A (corded)Return Policy30 daysWarranty Info2 yearsBest for Lower Back PainPhotograph: HypericeHypericeVenom 2 Back$269Amazon$269HypericeIf you experience daily aches or a sore lower back, a heated wrap is helpful, and a vibrating one is even better. The Venom 2 Back provides consistent heat distribution across the lower back with three adjustable levels (113, 122, and 131 degrees Fahrenheit) that can be paired with three vibration patterns. It's great for back pain relief and warm-ups before mobility workouts, as it stimulates circulation and loosens the muscles in your lower back. I especially appreciate the auto shut-off function, which lets me sit back and relax, knowing I don't have to worry about turning it off. Too much heat can intensify muscle soreness or cause inflammation, and we don't want that.SpecsBattery Life~3 hoursReturn Policy30 daysWarranty Info1 yearBest for Knee PainPhotograph: HydragunHydragun Heatpulse Knee Massager$149HydragunCommerce director Martin Cizmarinjured his knee while undertaking an “extremely large and ambitious cleaning project” and endured the pain for nearly a year before discovering a solution. The HydraKnee Pulse from Hydragun wraps around the joint and provides a blend of heat and vibration massage therapy. It can heat up to 158 degrees Fahrenheit, is rechargeable via USB-C, and features seven temperature settings along with three massage speeds. Martin mentions that he sets both options to maximum and relaxes until it shuts off automatically (after 30 minutes). The best part is its longer straps, allowing use on shoulders or larger limbs, along with a newly designed buckle suitable for slimmer limbs like elbows.P.S.: Consult a physician or physical therapist before self-treating any injuries.SpecsBattery Life~3 hoursReturn Policy30 daysWarranty Info18 monthsHonorable MentionPhotograph: HomedicsHoMedics Shiatsu + Air 4.0 Foot Massager with Heat for $140:This foot massager combines shiatsu-style kneading and air compression to better your circulation. I pop my toesies in and out (with socks on) of this massage tool during the work day, and it feels fabulous, with three intensities and three patterns. It fits feet up to a men’s size 13 and is compact enough to tuck under a desk or coffee table when not in use. The advertised heat function didn't work for me, quite literally; I didn't feel any warmth, but I still appreciate its place under my desk.Power up with unlimited access toWIRED.Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just$2.50$1 per month for 1 year.

They nourish the body,enhance the mind, and occasionally poison the unlucky. Their biochemical adaptability has intrigued Eastern cultures for centuries. The West has been slow to embrace mushrooms until the 21st century, propelled in part by endorsements from celebrities like Gisele Bündchen and Gwen Stefani.Today, in a zeitgeist fixated onbiohacking and self-optimization, mushrooms are now tools for functional wellness. Gone are the days of foraging and sautéing. Instead, we embrace microdosing.

The excitement surrounding them isn’t due to recent studies; their advantageshave been recognizedfor years. What has shifted is the way they are presented, allowing for simpler integration into contemporary lifestyles without the need for cooking. Brands likeRYZEandPlantFusionhave played a significant role in transforming these fungi from traditional remedies to nootropic supplements.“One of the OG brands wasFour Sigmatic,” recalls Brigitte Zeitlin, a NYC-based nutritionist who has swapped caffeine for mushroom coffee and matcha tea. “When they first hit shelves, people were like, ‘Wait, we drink mushrooms now?’.”“If you don’t like the taste or can’t find quality mushrooms at your store, supplements are a great second option,” she adds. “Some people hate swallowing pills or are already taking too many, sopowders are a great alternativebecause they're already broken down.”AVeryBrief HistoryFor as long as humans have been getting sick, they have relied on fungi as a means of healing. Hippocrates is said to have used amadou, a spongy fungus, to reduce inflammation.Ötzi the Icemanhad amadou in his supplies (probably for fire-starting), along with birch polypore, which was likely used to fight intestinal parasites. Native American cultures pressed puffball mushrooms onto wounds to halt bleeding and aid healing. Additionally, they usedtiger milk mushroomsto treat asthma.East Asian traditions have long used Phellinus fungi to treatdigestive issues.Ganoderma lucidum—commonly known as reishi or lingzhi—was first recorded in theShen Nong Ben Cao Jing, the oldest Chinese pharmacopeia written over two millennia ago, where it was classified as a tonic for anti-aging andboosting qi. In modern-day China, reishi is often recommended to support immune health inpatients undergoing chemotherapyor radiation.Inonotus obliquus—better known as chaga—has been a staple in traditional medicine among Indigenous communities across the world. Notably, native Siberians would grind up chaga and add it to teas, soups, and stews, believing it to ward off degenerative diseases. It was also a remedy for ulcers, liver ailments, and tuberculosis. Russian First Nations used it to slow the growth of visible tumors. Today, hunters in rural Russia still consume chaga to boost endurance on long treks.Are Mushroom Supplements Good for You?Photograph: Getty ImagesNutritionists agree: food first. Whole mushrooms like maitake, shiitake, and lion’s mane offer fiber and nutrients you won’t get from supplements. Toss them into stir-fries, omelets, or soups. While supplements don't always deliver the same results, here are some of the health benefits seen with regular intake.It may decrease the chance of cancer.Areviewof 17 cancer studies shows that consuming about 1/8 cup of mushrooms a day may lower your risk of cancer by as much as 45 percent. Fungi are packed with ergothioneine, an amino acid and antioxidant that slows cellular damage. Shiitake, oyster, maitake, and king oyster have some of the higher amounts of ergothioneine, but any variety of mushrooms is better than none.It can help protect brain health.In astudyin Singapore, participants who ate more than two cups of mushrooms (golden, oyster, shiitake, and white button) a week had a 50 percent lower risk of developing mild cognitive impairment.It encourages a healthy gut.Unlike many foods that are broken down by stomach acid,the polysaccharides in fungiremain intact as they pass through the stomach. This allows them to reach the colon, where they can prompt the growth of healthy bacteria.It can contribute to a healthy immune system.Certain shrooms also provide vital nutrientsthat can support your overall well-being. Cremini and portobello are high in selenium, a mineral that produces antioxidant enzymes to prevent cell damage. Maitake mushrooms are a great source of vitamin D, and incorporate Shiitake into your diet for vitamin B6.The Top Functional Mushrooms, ExplainedPhotograph: Ksenia Shestakova/Getty ImagesFrom nootropic lattes to adaptogenic powders, certain species have become stars in the wellness space. Here's what the research and experts have to say about the fungi dominating your feed.Chaga(Inonotus obliquus)Chaga, a white-rot fungus that thrives on birch trees in northern climates, is recognized for its abundant antioxidants. “If you have autoimmune issues like Hashimoto’s or psoriasis, Chaga mushrooms are awesome because they reduce inflammation,” says Zeitlin. Thoughmuch of the researchhas been conducted in vitro or on animals, Chaga demonstrates promising antimicrobial, anti-diabetic, and anti-inflammatory effects.Cordyceps(Cordyceps sinensis)Cordyceps is a parasitic fungus that sprouts on larvae of insects. In wellness marketing, it's the performance mushroom and a favorite among athletes.Research suggestscordyceps may help improve stamina and post-workout recovery by boosting ATP production and oxygen efficiency in cells. But many of those claims are based on early-stage research and lab models.Photograph: Getty ImagesLion's Mane(Hericium erinaceus)Marketed as brain food, lion’s mane is rich in terpenes like hericenones and erinacines that boost the production ofthe Nerve Growth Factor(NGF), a protein vital for the maintenance and regeneration of neurons.Preliminary researchalso indicates it may aid in nerve regeneration, reduce the risk of cognitive decline, and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. It’s important to note, though, since it might contain phytoestrogens that could activate estrogen-sensitive cells, those with a history of breast cancer should consult a physician before using it.Maitake (Grifola frondosa)Maitake (also known as hen-of-the-wood) contains beta-glucans that have been shown to activate lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and T-helper cells. Researchers are investigating its potential to help regulate blood pressure and blood sugar, particularly in individuals with metabolic issues. Zeitlin recommends maitake—and shiitake—mushrooms for those who have a history of chronic illnesses.Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum)Reishi is studied for calming effects and possible support for blood sugar and lung function, thanks to its high polysaccharide content. \"Reishi mushrooms are [for] a general wellness boost,\" Zeitlin says. \"If you're feeling stressed out, you get colds frequently, or it's spring season and your allergies are running amok, Reishi mushrooms are a supportive move.\"Shiitake(Lentinula edodes)Behind their umami-rich bite is a potent wellness profile: these mushrooms deliver lentinan, an immune-boosting polysaccharide, and eritadenine, known for supporting heart health by lowering cholesterol. Shiitake also reduces inflammation markers like CRP (C-reactive protein) and IgA (Immunoglobulin A). Plus, they’re packed with B vitamins to support energy, metabolism, and cardiovascular health.Turkey Tail(Trametes versicolor)This colorful mushroom gets its name from its resemblance to a turkey tail's feather, and it's one of the most researched macrofungus in oncology. Turkey tail is rich in protein-bound polysaccharides that stimulate immune responses, particularly in the function of T-cells and NK cells.When’s the Best Time to Take Mushroom Supplements?Courtesy of Four SigmaticLike most supplements, timing your mushroom intake depends on the specific variety and what you're hoping to get out of it.Let's start with mornings. If you're caffeine-sensitive, mushrooms can be an energizing swap. Lion's mane is a go-to for AM focus (especially during workdays) for its ability to support brain health, and cordyceps is a popular pre-workout boost. “Caffeine works by blocking the neurotransmitters that make us feel tired,” says Zeitlin, who regularly drinksmushroom coffee. “It doesn’t give us energy, it just stops the sensation of tiredness.”Chaga acts as a multitasker; it provides calmness without sedation, allowing it to enhance your morning coffee or offer an afternoon boost. Its earthy, mildly bitter taste has a coffee-like mouthfeel, contributing to its popularity. If you’re looking for immune support, incorporate turkey tail in the morning to prepare your body for a day of commuting. Finally, reishi is typically consumed in the evening to help relax the body.Are Mushroom Supplements Safe?In most cases, yes—while consuming mushrooms poses minimal risk for most people, unless you're allergic. Toss them into stir-fries, omelets, or soups.Concentrated mushroom supplements operate in murkier territory. The supplement industry isunder-regulated in the US, and that lack of oversight extends to functional fungi. Labels may not always reflect what's inside the package. “If you’re going the supplement route, look for products with natural ingredients and some sort of third-party regulation,” says dietitian Laura Wargo. “That gives you a clearer idea of what’s actually in them.”Be sure to take them with food to avoid any gastrointestinal discomfort. “Natural food is more bioavailable, and taking supplements with a meal can support better digestion,” Wargo says.Final TakeawaysIf you can eat your mushrooms, eat your mushrooms.Supplements are great insurance, but not a replacement for a well-balanced diet.Think purpose over timing.Different mushrooms shine at different times, but no matter when you take them, consistency is key.Always check with your doctor first.Meet the ExpertsLaura E.

    "content": "Save this storySaveSave this storySaveJesse Armstrong hadn’tplanned on making another project aboutbillionaires.TheSuccessioncreator was taking a break after finishing HBO’s Emmy-winning series about the ludicrously wealthy siblings fighting for control over their father’s media conglomerate, which ended in May 2023. But while writing areviewof journalist Michael Lewis’ bookGoing Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon,aboutcrypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, Armstrong got sucked into listening to podcasts featuring tech elites. It inspired him to write and direct his first feature:Mountainhead, a movie about three tech billionaires and their less rich, deeply insecure friend, all of whom have far too much power at their disposal.“I couldn't get the … tech voice, tech man voice, a billionaire, out of my head,” Armstrong says, noting that to him, that voice embodies both “supreme confidence in their analytical abilities” and “arrogance.” Armstrong is being nice here. The word that repeatedly came to my mind while watching the foursome trade jargon, insults, and delusions of grandeur for the movie’s nearly two-hour run time wasdouchebag.The film, which will start streaming on HBO May 31, stars Steve Carell as venture capitalist Randall; Jason Schwartzman as Hugo Van Yalk, whose nickname “Souper” is a reference to a soup kitchen—and his lower net worth; Cory Michael Smith as Venis, a Zuck-Elon figure unleashing hyperrealistic deepfakes on his platform Traam; and Ramy Youssef as Jeff, who plans on profiting big from releasing AI that can counter the chaos his pal Venis is wreaking on the world.The friends meet up for a retreat in the mountains, hosted by Souper, whose fixation on impressing the cohort with his home decor and food platters is met with scorn by the others. They have a “no deals, no meals, no high heels” rule for the weekend. But the fun—in their case, snowmobiling to a peak and writing their net worths on their chests with lipstick—is eventually superseded by plots to take over the world and “coup out the US.”Mountainheadcame together in just a few months, against the backdrop of President Donald Trump’s second term in office, much of which has been dominated by Elon Musk’s DOGE mission. Shooting took place over a few weeks this spring. While Carell says there were upsides to the tight turnaround—“everyone's just trusting their gut”—Schwartzman says quickly attaining fluency in the “tech voice” Armstrong was going for was a challenge for him.“At a certain point I said to Jesse, if you ever want us to say anything extra, do you have a glossary or a dictionary,” Schwartzman says. “It's like if you were doing a movie in French and then improvise something in Italian.”While Armstrong acknowledges that some people might react to his latest project by asking, “Why should I care about these rich assholes,” he refrains from outright making a judgment about them.“I do feel some sympathy for the real people grappling with some of this tech, because it is a bit of a hall of mirrors,” Armstrong says. “Lots of people go into, especially AI, with a sense of the power of the technology, and I think, as far as I can tell, a genuine sense of responsibility.”However, he says the “unbelievable amount of money” in the space, coupled with regulations that are often playing catch-up, make it “almost an inhuman task to keep your head straight about your desire to properly marshal the forces you're bringing into the world.” (He also describes the power of the Roys’ media empire inSuccessionas “quaint” compared to that of tech leaders.)Carell is similarly coy about “demonizing the characters” in the movie but offers a very human motivation to some of Randall’s actions. The film sees Randall grappling with a terminal cancer prognosis that he refuses to accept, demanding his doctor find a solution, and later banking on the idea of having his consciousness immortalized by tech. It’s a storyline that mimics real-world transhumanism movements, where entrepreneurs like Bryan Johnson are determinednot to die.“I think people are naturally afraid of death,” Carell says. “And he is, but he sees, somehow, he sees an out. He sees a way of cheating it. And so I think that motivates him to make decisions at the expense, basically, of the rest of the world.”Mountainheadends somewhat ambiguously, with deals afoot and the fate of the world still very much in the hands of these four men. It’s too bad that part doesn’t feel like satire.",

But we have to preface this with a disclaimer: You’re going to spend roughly a third of your life on a mattress, so there are probably better places to save a buck. But for tight budgets (or guest bedrooms), we’ve tested more than a dozen inexpensive mattresses under $1,000 that you can buy online and have conveniently shipped to you in a box in a matter of days.Buying a cheap mattress online is easy and efficient—a box comes to you with no need for a truck or professional movers. Just lug the bed-in-a-box inside, crack the cardboard, slash open the plastic wrap, andwatch the mattress spring into shape. If your prime focus is cost and convenience, you do have some good options with these cheap mattresses you can buy online. The prices below are based on queen size.The best cheap mattresses we've tested are theS Performance Bedgear MattressandWolf 12-Inch Memory Foam Hybrid Medium Firm Mattress—these mattresses don't feel cheap, and are two of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on from the two dozen I've tested.Be sure to check out our other sleep guides, including theBest Mattresses,Best Organic Mattresses,Best Mattresses for Side Sleepers, andBest Cooling Mattresses.Updated May 2025: We've added the Brooklyn Bedding CopperFlex Hybrid, and updated links and prices.Best Cheap MattressCourtesy of BedgearPhotograph: Molly HigginsChevronChevronBedgearS Performance Mattress$1,000$925Amazon$799$749BedgearThis S Performance mattress from Bedgear isliterallycool to the touch—I was shocked. Most cooling mattresses only claim to be so because of the gel infusion, but somehow this mattress delivers. I tested the medium-firm mattress (Bedgear also has firm and plush options), which has a top Ver-Tex cover layer that’s silky-smooth and specially designed to reduce overheating. The second layer is an inch and a half of ventilated foam with vertically drilled holes to increase airflow and maintain structure. This has a high-density, durable base for foundational support, and it uses Bedgear’s Air-X mesh that has an open design to promote airflow and help regulate body temperature. This 10-inch bed ships free to the lower 48, has a 10-year manufacturer's warranty, and can be returned within 30 days if opened or within 100 days of purchase if unopened.I like a more plush bed, and I was happy with the medium mattress’s plushness—I think the actual “plush” option may have been too plush for my taste. This mattress popped up to size almost immediately, and I fell into it like a baby swaddled in a cool cloud. I love this bed so much, I replaced my original mattress with this one and am sometimes cold when I sleep on it because the cooling effect is no joke. This mattress is super comfortable and would be ideal for any hot sleeper.Opened items can be returned within 30 days of original purchase.The price ranges from $499 for a twin to $1,049 for a California king, with prices further changing depending on firmness.Best Cheap Hybrid MattressCourtesy of WolfPhotograph: Molly HigginsChevronChevronWolf12-Inch Memory Foam Hybrid Medium Firm Mattress$899$765Amazon$899WolfThis medium-firm hybrid mattress is 12 inches tall and has seven layers in total, combining coils and memory foams. The top comprises a breathable knit cover that helps with airflow, a textured cooling gel foam, and gel memory foam beneath. The top is all about cooling comfort before getting to the bottom half, which provides structure and support. The bottom has a small layer of a high-density plush support foam, then 8 inches of individually wrapped coils to aid with low-motion transfer and structure.This US-made mattress has a 101-night trial and a lifetime warranty. It feels much more expensive than its low price tag—individually wrapped coils give great support, while the top cooling foams help with pressure relief and keeping temperature regulated. This bed is listed as medium-firm but feels more like a true medium (maybe closer to medium-plush in my opinion) and was comfortable for a side sleeper like me. This cheap mattress far exceeded my expectations and has become one of my favorite mattresses I’ve tested.101-night trial.The price ranges from $749 for a twin to $1,099 for a king, with prices further changing depending on firmness and height.Best Cheap Natural MattressCourtesy of AwaraPhotograph: Molly HigginsChevronChevronAwaraNatural Luxury Hybrid$849AwaraThe Awara Natural Luxury Hybrid mattress is a natural, sustainably made, more affordable option from luxury bed brand Awara. It’s made of super soft wool with a rayon blend, breathable, quilted cover top followed by a layer of sustainable, GOLS- and FSC-certified organic foam along with a bottom layer of coils for increased spinal support and structure. This mattress is supportive and bouncy, and I appreciated the solid motion transfer. Also, after testing 20 mattresses, I appreciated the handles on the sides for easy moving.Awara lists it as a 6.5 out of 10 on the firmness scale, and it was a little too firm for me. I could literally feel the metal support coils when I ran my hand along the side, and the edge support was lacking. This hybrid, organic mattress is inexpensive for being from a great luxury brand, but it was a little too firm, and those springs were a little too pronounced for my taste. But it’s still a great value for a luxury natural mattress.365-night trialThe price ranges from $549 for a twin to $1,398 for a split king, although the mattresses are often discounted.Best Copper-Infused MattressCourtesy of Brooklyn BeddingPhotograph: Molly HigginsChevronChevronBrooklyn BeddingCopperFlex Hybrid$932$699Brooklyn BeddingAs a person who generally prefers memory foam mattresses, I was super pleasantly surprised by this affordable CopperFlex hybrid mattress from Brooklyn Bedding. (We also reviewed—and liked—the CopperFlexmattress topper.) It features copper-infused foam, lumbar support in three key areas, and low motion transfer. It has six layers—the quilt foam top is extremely comfy and slowly conforms to your body's pressure points (feels like a gel foam top), followed by the star of the show: the copper-infused memory foam, then Variflex IQ memory foam that is specifically designed to contort to your body’s curves. The last layer before the structural support targets your lumbar area and aims to help with spinal alignment. The bottom layer has proprietary Ascension X coils to help reduce motion transfer and increase edge support, along with a high-density foam for even more structural support.The bed is listed as a medium-firm 7 out of 10, with 10 being the firmest, and even though I like more plush beds, those top layers have enough contorting plushness that it was soft enough for me. This bed-in-a-box sprang up immediately after opening and has a 10-year warranty. This bed feels much more expensive than its price tag, and the coil and the copper-infused foams work well to provide structure while conforming to your body’s pressure points.120-night trial.The price ranges from $466 for a twin to $839 for a California king.Another Great Hybrid MattressCourtesy of DreamCloudPhotograph: Molly HigginsChevronChevronDreamCloudHybrid Mattress$649DreamCloudThis 12-inch DreamCloud Hybrid Mattress is composed of eight layers and uses gel memory foam and innerspring coils for a truly hybrid sleeping experience. The top is a breathable cashmere blend to help with cooling, followed by several layers of quilted and gel memory foams; the bottom half starts with a “transition layer” to provide support for the individually wrapped coils and a bottom base layer to help with stability. Unlike nearly every cheap mattress model we tested, it also has handles for easier carrying—a huge help after testing (and hauling) over a dozen mattresses.The bed has a 365-night home trial, a lifetime warranty, and free shipping. This in-a-bed-box sprang up literally immediately, and the coils helped in making this one of the bounciest I’ve tested. The bed's advertising promised edge support, which was lacking, but I’ve noticed this as an issue in other beds using coils. I liked the dynamic layering and the bed was comfortable, but I tend to like true memory foam mattresses more. I also didn’t really notice the cooling effect and slept hot a few nights.365-night trial.The price ranges from $399 for a twin to $1,098 for a split king, with prices further changing depending on mattress material.Best Medium-Soft MattressAllswellSupreme 14-Inch Bed in a Box Hybrid Mattress$487WalmartThe Allswell Supreme 14-inch Bed in a Box Hybrid Mattress is listed as having medium firmness, but it was more on the plush side. The top layer is 1.5 inches of Allswell’s signature quilted Euro top, which gives it the plush feel; 1 inch of copper-infused memory foam—which helps with moisture absorption to keep it cool; 2 inches of “fast response” memory foam, which absorbs motion and bounces back into shape quickly; 0.75 inch of high-density medium support foam to further absorb motion; and the bulk of the bottom is 8 inches of encased coils—which means each coil is encased individually, so each moves independently to easier contour to the shape of your body; the bottom layer is a quarter-inch shock-absorbing high-density foam.One of my biggest complaints was the lack of edge support. When sitting on the edge of the bed, the top layer completely buckled and met the top of the box spring support, and I could literally slide off the mattress. I like a softer mattress, so this was comfortable for me, but I think if I wanted something truly medium-firm I would be disappointed.Offers no trial period.The price ranges from $337 for a twin to $577 for a California king, with prices changing depending on material.Best Super-Cheap MattressCourtesy of WayfairPhotograph: Molly HigginsChevronChevronWayfairSleep 12-Inch Medium Cooling Gel Memory Foam Mattress$360$270Birch Lane$500$270WayfairThis mattress from Wayfair feels more plush (or medium-plush) than its listed medium-firmness. It has four layers of hypoallergenic gel memory foam infused with green tea and features low motion transfer, cooling technology, and a breathable design to ensure you’re having a cool sleep. The top layers are gel-infused memory and comfort foams to help with pressure relief and cooling; then 2.5 inches of super soft Zinus comfort foam; the bottom thick layer is 5.5 inches of Zinus’ high-density base foam for more durable support—the foam isCertiPUR-US certified(meaning it meets certain standards for emissions and durability).This mattress comes compressed inside a box, so all you need to do is unroll and it should expand to its full size within 72 hours. Mine sprang up almost immediately, and I was able to sleep on it without issue after about 12 hours. There was a very strong chemical odor for the first several hours of unboxing, but it did go away with time. This bed had the perfect balance of cooling and comfort with the memory foam—the breathable knitted cover also helped with air circulation—and I always slept coolly.100-night trial.The price ranges from $214 for a twin to $450 for a king, although prices change often.Courtesy: WayfairOthers We TestedWayfair Sleep 8-Inch Medium Cooling Gel Memory Foam Mattress for $122: Thissupercheap cooling mattress consists of 8 inches of regular memory foam with a layer of cooling gel, charcoal, and green tea-infused memory foam (to aid with freshness and odor absorption), followed by a soft comfort foam on a durable high-density foam base to help with all-around pressure relief. The top layer has a breathable, woven jacquard design that helps keep the sleeper cool and has a tight enough foam top to help with reducing motion transfer. The mattress ships right to your door, is compatible with an adjustable base, has a 100-night trial, and a 10-year manufacturer’s warranty.Wayfair Sleep 13.5-Inch Medium Cooling Gel Memory Foam Mattress for $280:This 13.5-inch cooling gel memory foam mattress is listed as medium-firm, but is by far the most plush mattress I’ve ever slept on. The top layer is 2 inches of gel-infused memory foam, followed by 4.5 inches of comfort foam, and the bottom is 7 inches of high-density base support foam. This in-a-box bed sprang up to size almost immediately, has low motion transfer, a 100-night trial, and a limited 10-year warranty. This behemoth of a bed was super comfy and literally enveloped my body, but I don’t think I’d want a bed with so little structure for the long term. If you are someone who loves a super-plush bed, then this is the mattress for you.Wayfair Sleep 14-Inch Plush Cooling Gel Hybrid Mattress for $340: This 14-inch plush cooling gel mattress feels expensive without the price tag to match. It has a top layer of cooling gel that conforms to your body for comfort and has classic pocket coils below for structure and support, with layers of memory foam with varying thickness surrounding the coils (the coils and memory foam mixture helps with low-motion transfer, too). The knit cover and sides help with breathability and the overall “cooling effect.” This mattress is the most plush I've tested, but didn’t feel like it lacked structure because of its generous height and coils. I love a plush mattress, but I could see it maybe being a bit too plush for someone with a bigger body, since the first super-soft memory foam layer is on top of a coil system.Wayfair Sleep Evan 10.5-Inch Plush Cooling Gel Hybrid Mattress for $280: The top is memory foam, then a plush poly foam, wrapped innersprings, and a bottom high-density base foam; the memory foam pillow top aims to relieve pressure points and help reduce motion transfer, it’s made out of hypogenic materials, and has a breathable knit cover to aid in the cooling effect. The bed is compatible with an adjustable base, has a 100-night trial, and a 10-year warranty. This was a super comfortable, true plush mattress. But it wasn’t as breathable as promised, so I wouldn’t recommend it if you sleep hot or want a noticeably cool mattress.Wayfair Sleep 14-Inch Medium Memory Foam Mattress for $290: This 14-inch medium-firm memory foam mattress strikes a great balance with structured firmness and a memory foam top that contorts to your shape. It’s constructed fromCertiPUR-US-certifiedfoams and a cotton-based fire retardant for added safety. The adjustable base-compatible mattress has a 10-year manufacturer's warranty, and a 100-night trial. Although I tend to go for more plush mattresses, it has a great balance between that medium-firm structure and the soft, contorting open-cell memory foam. This bed pleasantly surprised me and I’d definitely recommend it for anyone who likes a bit more of a medium-firm feel.Wayfair Sleep 12-Inch Medium Memory Foam Mattress for $270: This 12-inch medium-firm memory foam mattress has a breathable jacquard pattern covering to help with airflow and a top 2-inch layer of green tea-infused memory foam to help with freshness and odor control, followed by 3.5 inches of high-density foam. The rest is 6.5 inches of more high-density foam. The top layer has a bit more give, and the memory foam contorts to the body’s pressure points while the bottom layers are dense (helping with the firmness). The mattress has good edge support, surprisingly low motion transfer, is adjustable base-compatible, has a 100-night trial, and 10-year manufacturer's warranty. Like all others on this list, the bed comes in a box. However, it didn’t fully expand until 12-plus hours after unwrapping and is a bit firm for my taste.One to AvoidWayfair Sleep 6-Inch Medium Memory Foam Mattress for $152: This 6-inch memory foam mattress from Wayfair Sleep is labeled as medium on the firmness scale, and looks and feels like a plush camping pad. I will admit, I was very worried when I took this from-a-box mattress out—it was vacuum sealed and didn’t spring up for nearly a day. Once it did, it was still very thin. I measured it and the pad is a little over 5.5 inches. If I put too much pressure on one area, I could feel my hard box spring underneath—I don’t think this would work on a frame without some type of structure below. I struggled with sleeping hot throughout a few of the nights, as the cover is made of polyester and the majority of the mattress is made of high-density foam without the aid of cooling gel or super breathable top fabric.Why a Cheap Mattress?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronLike stated above, we don't necessarily think skimping on this purchase is the best decision—after all, you'll be spending roughly a third of your life on it. But, if you're looking for a temporary bed, something cheap for your office or guest room, or somewhere where people won't be sleeping everyday, going a bit more inexpensive makes sense. However, if you're just on a tight budget and are looking for a bed under a grand, some of thesereallyimpressed me.The Pros and Cons of Buying a Mattress OnlineAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronOnline-only retailers like Amazon are a solid place to buy almost anything, but it's less advantageous for mattress purchases than most other goods. That's because domestic manufacturers dominate the bed-in-a-box game, and you can often get a better deal by buying from the mattress maker directly. Some of these brands throw in two pillows with your purchase or have other discounts, though this is not always true—a few mattresses in this guide are actually cheaper on Amazon.Most from-a-box mattresses sold online tend to be cheaper than those sold in stores, which is the main draw. You can easily compare various versions of the same thing (i.e., memory foam or hybrid mattresses) and get fast, dependable shipping straight to your house.Many online retailers' terms for returning goods have an exception for mattresses. Once you open the box, you are at the mercy of the maker instead of being covered by the more generous terms these online retailers like Amazon offer for most products they sell. If you're looking at mattresses below $500, you should not expect any test period or money-back guarantee (whereas that's a reasonable thing to expect of any mattress above $1,000). Things vary widely in the middle zone.The drawback to online shopping is you can't test a showroom of mattresses until you find the perfect fit. Add in the fact thatreviewscan be gamed by bad actors, and it's hard to know what's worth your time and what's not. WIRED has done the work for you, spending at least a week, if not longer, sleeping on some of the cheapest mattresses you can buy online—we're looking for a great night's sleep at a good value.How We TestedAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWe slept on a variety of mattresses of differing firmness, materials, and filling to find what we consider to be the best mattresses at a budget-friendly price point for at least a week at a time.

    "content": "Save this storySaveSave this storySaveOne of thebiggest changes of Nintendo's generationalleap to the Switch 2is the new console's game carts. Not the aesthetic shift—they're now red, to differentiate them from the original Switch's slate gray ones—but rather that, in many cases, they won't contain a game at all.While all first-party Nintendo games are currently expected to be released on-cart, other publishers may choose to release their Switch 2 titles on “game-key cards.” These have no actual game data on them, instead serving as a physical license to access and play a digital version of a game.Per Nintendo, after players insert the game-key card into their console, they'll be prompted to download the associated game. An internet connection will be required to download the game and for any online features, but otherwise, game-key card titles will be playable offline as normal, so long as that physical cartridge is inserted, its presence serving as a software authentication tool.It's a direction that has proven controversial with both fans and some developers (formerAssassin's CreedandFar Crylead Alex Hutchinsonsaid, “I think it’s sort of lame,” while Nightdive Studios CEO Stephen Kicksaidthe move is “a little disheartening”) and could be confusing for consumers, despite Nintendo's plans toclearly markthe packaging of game-key card titles. However, the move does have several positives—and it may just be a harbinger of the future for the entire games industry.Better Than Literally NothingProbably the biggest plus point to game-key cards is that they're an improvement on the current equivalent, which is … nothing at all. Switch cartridges are a proprietary storage format, which means they can be more expensive, per GB of storage, to release games on than mass-market media. As a result, several game publishers sell titles in a “code in a box” format—entirely empty Switch cases with a single-use, digital download code to redeem on the Nintendo eShop.While these sorts of releases ostensibly fill a market gap, giving real-world retailers a product to put on shelves and, even for online sellers, providingsomeform of physical object to send to customers—useful to give out as gifts, for instance—they've always been an odd category. Collectors typically want an actual game on their shelves, while those unbothered by a permanent library would likely be browsing a digital-only storefront in the first place. Either way, once that code has been redeemed, the customer is left with an empty plastic case with no purpose and no secondary market value. Code-in-a-box releases are ultimately a waste of materials to produce and dispose of, the remnants likely destined for landfill.Game-key cards go some small way to solving these problems. For collectors, they'll havesomethingin the case lining their shelves, making their collections tangible, while more casual players can take a chance on titles they're unsure of. That's because the cartswon't be tiedto user accounts—anyone with the cart downloads their own copy of the game. Because the cartridge itself is the key, you'll be able to lend out, sell, or trade-in game-key cards as easily as carts for previous console generations, and only whoever physically possesses it will be able to play.There is still a convenience factor to consider, as you'll need to have that cart inserted into your Switch 2 to play the game, unlike entirely digital purchases, but it stands to be a far more versatile and arguably consumer-friendly approach than those one-time codes. We'll have chance to see which format players prefer with the first wave of Switch 2 titles, as titles like EA'sSplit Fictionsticks with the code-in-a-box approach.The biggest concern surrounding game-key cards, particularly for collectors, is likely to be longevity. A 40-year-old NES game cart can still be played on a working console—will the same be possible for a Switch 2 game in 2065? A game-key card would, presumably, still authenticate an already installed game to run (in this hypothetical, your Switch 2 console is still intact and working decades from now, too), but if the servers aren't running anymore to enable downloading the linked software in the first place, that cart would be useless—just moree-waste.However, Switch 2 games could still be available to download for a long time. There's precedent here—although the Wii virtual store has long since been deactivated for new purchases, playerscan still downloadtheir existing purchases. Similarly, 3DS games and even update data canalso be redownloaded, more than a year after its online store was turned off.Those might represent different scenarios, given digital purchases on those earlier platforms were tied to the specific piece of hardware. (For example, Nintendo says you need \"the same Wii console you used to originally download the game\" to redownload.) Nintendo has since adopted an account-based structure for Switch 1, linking purchases to the user who bought them, and transferable to a new console.That leaves game-key cards in a sort of limbo, unaffiliated with either hardware or user. That could throw up unforeseen hurdles in the much longer term—there'd be no way to predict when a game-key card in the wild would be plugged in and need a game to download—but based on Nintendo's track record for supporting digital games on retired hardware, there doesn't appear to be anything to be immediately concerned about, especially whenbackward compatibility on Switch 2is looking like a priority.It is fair to wonder why, if publishers are releasing a game on a cart at all, they wouldn't just put the game on there anyway. There are likely some practical reasons to explain this, though. Like the original Switch, the proprietary format again means cards that include flash memory to store game data on are more expensive to produce, so it's a way to keep production costs down. Don't expect a consumer benefit from that, but it will make business sense, somewhere.Pushing the LimitThen there's the matter of storage limits. Switch 2 carts can hold a maximum of 64 GB of data—double the total internal capacity on the original Switch console itself, but still pretty meager compared to game sizes now. Some studios have performed some dark compression magic—CD Projekt Red has crammedCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which weighs in at over 70 GB on PC, down to just 56.8 GB on Switch 2 to be one of the few third-party titles shipping with the full game data on the card—but other games may be larger than an actual Switch 2 cart could hold.Games exceeding the capacity of physical media isn't unique to Nintendo. The recent PS5 release ofIndiana Jones and the Great Circlehas only 20 GB on-disc, which sounds paltry when you consider a PS5 disc can hold up to 100 GB of data, but not when the installed size of the game is over 120 GB. Bethesda'sDoom: The Dark Ages,too, ships with only85 MB of data on the game disc(although there, the full install potentially could fit on a disc). However, like Nintendo's game-key cards, both of these prompt players to download the actual game in full.It's worth remembering that even when a game's dataison a disc or cart at launch it's rarely the full and final version of a game nowadays. Even for single-player titles, day-one patches, updates, bug fixes, and bonus DLC can drastically change a game after release (which raises philosophical questions for preservationists too—which iteration do you save?) and require more storage space. As data demands continue to balloon, we may have reached the limit of physical storage for video games, so game-key cards (or discs) may be the best we get.In that light, Nintendo providing any material release at all is actually a small win for fans of physical media, especially given how boxed-game sales have absolutely cratered. Industry analyst Mat Piscatellahighlightedin January 2025 that spending on physical games in the US has halved since 2021 and is down 85 percent on a 2008 high. In the UK, a recent study by trade body UKIE found that physical sales accounted for just4 percentof total spend in 2024 and represented a 34 percent fall year on year. Increasingly, consumers are choosing to go digital even when a physical option exists.Even collector's editions, those bastions of physical media, are now abandoning physical copies of their game. Sony's upcomingGhost of Yōteicosts $250 for the premium package and still provides just a download code for the game itself. Physical releases are becoming an afterthought.These shifts in consumer and corporate behavior absolutely raise questions about game preservation and long-term access to the games we play, but those questions apply across the whole industry. As it stands, Nintendo's game-key cards may end up being physical gaming media's last gasp—even though they don't have a game on them at all.",

Pick any major city and most aspects look and feel broadly familiar, yet the fundamentals are different. You can’t hail anUberor useGoogle Mapsto get around, and your hotel TV won’t haveNetflix. Instead, there’s always a domestic alternative. One that is likely newer, bigger, quicker, and perhaps even better than what you’re used to back home.And so to theChinese car industry, whose latest opportunity to scare the living daylights out of Europe and the US came at the Auto Shanghai motor show. Held at the world’s second-largest exhibition space, the show saw more than 1,400 cars from 26 countries spread across 13 halls. Some 93 vehicles made their world debut in front of 1 million attendees. YouTubers would later upload whole-show walk-throughs with run times longer thanInterstellar.How many world debuts do you suppose took place at the 2024 Geneva International Motor Show? About a dozen. No wonder it wascanceledfor 2025.In Shanghai, BYD-owned Denza showed off its electric Porsche 911 rival.Photograph: Getty ImagesTo Western eyes, photos of Auto Shanghai are akin to askingChatGPTto recreate the glory days of motor shows past. Anyone who strolled the cavernous convention halls of Paris, Frankfurt, Geneva, Detroit, even Birmingham, and gawped at the new and the exciting will recognize the scene. There’s lots of shiny metal and carbon, formed into cars of every conceivable size, shape and social status. But the badges are unfamiliar, model names nonsensical; prices implausibly low, performance claims from another planet.Admittedly, some cars are dressed in fur like children’s toys, complete with bunny ears and tail, but perhaps that’s just the AI hallucinating. This still largely looks like the sort of auto show Europe and the US hosted every few months in a prepandemic world.Names like Jetour,Denza, iCar, Changan, Hongqi andLuxeedwon’t ring many bells. Keep walking and you’ll catch a reassuring glimpse of Audi, Lotus, Buick, and Volkswagen, but the spark of familiarity they bring is quickly extinguished by a stark realization: They are no longer in Shanghai to show the fledgling locals how it’s done, as beacons of a Western industry riding high on a century of success. They’re surrounded by younger, fitter, and keener rivals with a hunger to put a ding in the universe. And there’s about to be a feeding frenzy.Award Winners and OddballsHighlights of this year’s Shanghai show included theJetour G900, a range-extended electric SUV with two rear-mounted turbines for use as a boat; an electricPorsche 911 rivalfrom BYD-owned Denza; the award-winning XpengM03 Mona; and theMaextro S800, a Maybach-rivaling luxury sedan from Huawei.Yes, thatHuawei. The telecom company oversees the Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance (HIMA), which includes car brands like AITO, Stelato, and SAIC, itself another auto group that includes Roewe, Rising Auto,Wuling, and former British sports car maker MG, among others.The R7 from Luxeed, one of the younger, keener rivals putting a ding in the Western auto industry universe.Photograph: Getty ImagesThere was also Luxeed, a brand related to both Huawei and Chery, the latter of which sold over 2.5 million cars in 2024 and is the parent of Jaecoo, Omoda, Lepas and iCar. Those names might not be familiar to you yet, but they soon will be. Many will land on your radar because of their low prices. Dig a little deeper and you’ll find that theJaecoo 7, a well-priced hybrid SUV, is already selling over 700 units a month in the UK. Anose-diving Teslaregistered just 536 cars there in April.Auto Shanghai had plenty of oddballs too. Ora followed up on itsFunky Catwith theBallet Cat, which curiously borrows much of its styling from the original VW Beetle.Songsanfilled its stand with cars inspired by late-’50s Americana, including a seven-door take on the VW Microbus and a proportionally challenged revival of a first-generation Corvette. A handful of cars appeared to be inexplicably dressed as cuddly toys, one sharing its stand with a giant comb. Another, theBaojun Yep, had a massive ice cream cone dunked on its roof for reasons unclear.The Baojun Yep had a massive ice cream cone dunked on its roof in Shanghai for reasons still unclear.Photograph: Johannes Neudecker/Getty Images320 Miles in 5 MinutesSuch fever dreams won't give Western brands sleepless nights, but the EV technology coming out of China in 2025 certainly will. BYD used the Shanghai show to reveal a charging system powerful enough to deliver 259 miles of range in five minutes, at a peak speed of 1,000 kW—10 times the charge rate of a Mini Cooper.Soon after, domestic rivalCATLwent one better with its 1,300 kW of charging power, enough to deliver 323 miles of range in five minutes. For context, Europe’s fastest-charging EVs, like thePorsche Taycan, fill their batteries at a mere 320 kW.As well as dazzling tech, Chinese automakers are also majoring on small, low-price cars that appeal to Europe, the UK, and even emerging markets. Perfectly decent EVs—on paper, at least—are soon expected to land below the €20,000 ($22,700) barrier. Established marques like Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault should soon be there too. But with models like the VW ID.1 not due in showrooms until 2027, cut-price alternatives from China’s Leapmotor, Lepas, and Firefly could quickly sweep up all the drivers wondering whatever happened to the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Up.Things Sure Have ChangedIt wasn’t always this way. Oh, how we once laughed when each year brought a Chinese motor show filled with poor imitations of European bestsellers.Rewind a decade—just a single generation in car years—and the cream of Europe’s prestigious brands would reveal world-beating hypercars in the convention halls of Geneva and Paris, while China’s auto shows were, to the West, a laughing stock. Glitzy as they may have been, the show floors of Beijing and Shanghai in the mid-2010s featured flagrant knockoffs of British and European cars. Brands like Changan, BYD, Zotye, and Hongqi revealed vehicles unashamedly aping the latest designs of Mercedes, Ford, Land Rover, McLaren, and Porsche.One of the hits of this year’s Shanghai show was the Jetour G900, a range-extended electric SUV with two rear-mounted turbines for use as a boat. Yes, a boat.Photograph: Getty ImagesThe most infamous of all the copycats was theLandwind X7, which looked so similar to the Range Rover Evoque that, after four years of legal battles, a Chinese court ruled in favor of JLR, demanding the car be taken off sale and the British company awarded compensation.Six years on, and with JLR absent from Shanghai 2025, China no longer feels the need to copy the West. Instead, it is the US and Europe being forced to play catch-up. Audi hit the Caps Lock key and used Auto Shanghai to reveal the first car of its China-only sub-brand, called AUDI.Lowercase Audi said AUDI’s new E5 Sportback “offers the very best qualities of Audi, reimagined for and tailored to customers in China.” The German company claimed its engineering prowess is being blended with China’s own digital ecosystems and innovations, and that the AUDI division, which drops the iconic four-ringed logo, marks the beginning of a new era for the company in the region, “ensuring rapid response to the evolving demands of the Chinese market.” It will be interesting to see if this China-flavored AUDI Audi—reversing the trend of Chinese makers increasingly nailing the Western auto taste—is a success.Audi has hit the Caps Lock key and used Auto Shanghai to reveal the first car of its China-only sub-brand, called “AUDI”, the E5 Sportback.Courtesy of AudiSome Western brands might need a rapid-response unit of their own, since not only are their sales falling in China, but the popularity of Chinese upstarts elsewhere is surging.BYDexpects to double its overseas sales in a single year, rising from 417,000 vehicles in 2024 to over 800,000 in 2025. With US sales on ice, an increasingly brand-agnostic UK is poised to become a key battleground for BYD, along withLatin Americaand Southeast Asia.Elon Musk’s biggest headache has also found success in Australia, where BYD sales hit 40,000 units in 2024 (matching those of a Tesla rapidly heading in the opposite direction), and are on track to double in 2025. Where Tesla has failed to expand its two-vehicle lineup, BYD has grown from one model in Australia in 2022, to six just three years later.China’s Smart Western Hiring SpreeIt’s easy to credit Beijing’s massive investment in China’s nascent auto sector as a prime contributor to its success. But China’s closing of the gap to, and in many cases overtaking, US and European carmakers isn’t due to cash and copying alone. Just as the Japanese and Korean brands did before them, the Chinese have hired smartly.Luxury sedan maker Hongqi took on Rolls-Royce design head Giles Taylor as its own global vice president of design in 2018. Similarly, Bentley design chief Stefam Sielaff headed to Geely in 2021, while 2024 saw Jozef Kaban—whose pencil gave us the era-defining Bugatti Veyron—swap Audi for MG, a part of Chinese giant SAIC. Stellantis UK managing director Maria Grazia Davino moved to BYD that same year, and JuanMa Lopez, who spent a decade as head of exterior design at Ferrari, moved to Xpeng.The Chery iCar C23 is a small off-road EV priced at the equivalent of $13,000—and hits the UK in 2026.Photograph: Gao Yang/Getty ImagesBack to Shanghai, and the hits kept on coming. TheNio ET7promised 620 miles of range from a battery bigger than that of aRolls-Royce Spectre. The HuaweiAITO M9 SUVhas a projector screen for entertaining passengers in the second and third rows. The CheryiCar C23, a small electric off-road with the approach and departure angles of a mountain goat, is priced at the equivalent of $13,000 (and is coming to the UK in 2026, to the delight of Suzuki Jimny fans).Headed to the Australian market for under $30,000, theDeepal E07gave the TeslaCybertrucka lesson in practicality, with the ability to transform its cargo area from the interior of an SUV to the open bed of a truck.Riding the WaveAnd it wasn’t just a show for EVs. Gas-powered cars shared the floor with all manner of hybrids, range-extended EVs that use engines as generators, and even old-school, stick-shift trucks with turbo-diesel engines ready to conquer emerging markets with rock-bottom prices.At the other end of the market,Hongqishowed off vehicles with the thick carpets, dashboard artwork, and limitless customization normally reserved for Rolls-Royce. ItsGuoyue luxury minibuseven riffs on Rolls’ headliner filled with twinkling LED stars.Songsan filled its Shanghai stand with cars inspired by late-’50s Americana.Photograph: Zhe Ji/Getty ImagesBut focusing on what China’s still bunging into the photocopier misses the point. Here is an auto industry that—after substantial government support, it must be reiterated—is booming like no other. And, most worryingly of all, it’s an industry no longer content with serving its own enormous market.Chinese brands are already making serious inroads across Australia and Europe. In May, it was reported that, for the first time, BYD sold more cars on the continent than Tesla in the previous month. BYD only entered Europe in 2020, and it waited two years before even expanding beyond Norway and the Netherlands.Tesla’s growth at the start of this decade was equally staggering, but from the US there has been no follow-up act.Faraday Futurewas a failure,Slate Autois fun but niche. Cash-hemorrhagingLucidandRivianare yet to touch foreign shores, and meanwhile behind BYD the tide has just gone out, and a tsunami is about to hit.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.Home Depot goes hard. The company pretty much invented the hardware superstore when it began in 1978, just by being so big. They inflated the neighborhood tool shop into a whole city of lumber, hammers, caulk, power saws, and big rolls of wire. I would know I’m in a Home Depot blindfolded, because of a distinct quality to the air—crisp and particulate, smelling like wood dust and paint and the oiled metal of power tools. The Home Depot smell is buried deep in my childhood, filed somewhere between “building a deck” and “first day of spring.” Anyway, the Home Depot website is just as big. And while it doesn’t smell like sawdust, it’s easier to find stuff. And as it turns out, the hardware giant also goes hard on discounts, slashinggrillsandgardenand outdoor power tools by up to 50 percent for Memorial Day, not to mention smokers like the new Traieger Woodridge (8/10, WIRED Recommends) alsosold at Home Depot. Our roundup of Home Depot promo codes, new customer coupons, free shipping, and Pro rewards discounts, can drop prices by as much as 60% when you buy online.Get 10% Off With Today’s Home Depot Promo Codes and Summer OffersHome Depot coupons and deals tend to ramp up in Summer, when people start refreshing their house and backyard, with deals of up to 50 percent onpatio furniture,bath, mattresses andarea rugsfor Spring Decor Days.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.If you don't know where to start—and use—your HP coupon code, there’s a wide variety of options available at HP.com in terms of budget and use case, but my eye goes first to the high-end HP Omen gaming monitors, like the fantasticHP Omen Transcend 32. This 4K 240Hz monitor is a favorite among PC gamers, even among the huge amounts of OLED options out there. It can hit a peak brightness of over 1,000 nits in HDR, bringing scenes in games to life in vivid detail.Or if you’re on the other side of the budget spectrum and just need something basic, we recommend checking out one of HP’s 27-inch 1080p monitors, such as theHP V27i G5, which retails for $209. It even comes with a 75Hz refresh rate, a small but appreciated bump over the standard 60Hz. We have HP coupon codes to help you save on all this tech and even more below.Get 20% Off With HP Coupon CodesHP is one of the biggest monitor, desktop, and PC manufacturers in the world, and there are some limited time promo codes you won’t want to miss.

While you can’t use it in addition to the other coupons, it might be a better discount if you’re purchasing something less expensive. To get this HP promo code, your order has to be $65 or more though (before taxes and shipping), and it requires signing up for the HP newsletter.This HP promo code is valid for a month after subscribing to the newsletter and is restricted to one per customer. If you aren’t planning to spend too much and it’s your first time buying from HP.com, this could be the way to go.Save 40% on Tech With the HP Student DiscountIf you’re a student—or a parent to a student, teacher, school faculty, or university staff member—you’re in luck. HP is offering a serious 40% off discount on all kinds of tech, including laptops, desktop PCs, printers, and accessories. All stuff you’ll need for school, of course.HP rebranded its laptops in 2024, introducing the OmniBooks into the world, including the premium HP OmniBook Ultra Flip. Powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chips and a killer OLED display, the OmniBook Ultra Flip would be agreat laptop for collegethanks to its long-lasting battery life, especially with a 40% discount for students or teachers.It’s not just laptops though. TheHP Education Program discountapplies to desktop PCs, printers, and tons more qualifying products.HP Military Discount: Get 40% Off the Latest TechHP offers more than just a standard military discount. The company’s exclusive military discount is extended to support active service members, veterans, and their families, but also healthcare workers and First Responders.If you belong to any of those groups, theHP military discountwill drop the retail prices significantly, whether you’re searching for a new laptop, PC, mouse, and many more select products at HP.com.Get an HP Discount on Gaming LaptopsHP’shigh-performance gaming laptops and PCsare also included in this coupon code. HP has two brands of gaming laptops to choose from: the more affordable Victus and the higher-end Omen. Finding agaming laptopunder $1,000 can be tricky, especially since you’ll want something that doesn’t use a 5-year old GPU and only 8 GB of memory. That’s why I’d avoid the cheapest Victus laptop here, and bump up to at least theVictus 16t-r100. That gets you an RTX 4050 and 16 GB of RAM, despite costing only $150 more.Meanwhile, the higher-end Omen models get you access to the new RTX 50-series graphics cards, and the newmulti-frame generation featurethat’s got everyone talking. They also come with a 16-inch 1920 x 1200 screen with a 240Hz refresh rate, such as theOmen Max gaming laptop.Beyond gaming laptops, HP gaming desktops like the opulentOmen 45Lwill also be discounted when using this coupon code. Like the Omen Max laptops, the Omen 45L comes with RTX 50-series graphics.",

    "content": "Save this storySaveSave this storySaveWhile Netflix seeminglyled the way for other streaming networks to create compelling original programming, Hulu actually beat them all to the punch. In 2011, a year beforeNetflix’sLilyhammerand two years before the arrival ofHouse of Cards, the burgeoning streamer premieredThe Morning After, a pop-culture-focused news show that ran for 800 episodes over three years.Hulu has continued to make TV history in the years since, most notably in 2017 when it became the first streamer to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series withThe Handmaid’s Tale(which dropped its long-awaited final season in April). In the years since, the streamer has continued to match—and often exceed—that high bar for quality entertainment with shows likeThe Bear, which took home 11 Emmys in 2024, andShōgun, which recently set an Emmy record with 18 wins in a single season.While more competition has popped up since Hulu started gaining critical credibility, the network has continued to stand out for its carefully curated selection of original series and network partnerships that make it the home of FX series and more. Below are some of our favorite shows streaming on Hulu right now.Not finding what you’re looking for?

This helps support our journalism.Learn more.Welcome to WrexhamIn 2020, actor pals Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney decided to take their friendship to the next level—by purchasing Wales’ Wrexham AFC, one of the world’s oldest football (aka soccer) clubs, which had long been struggling and was on the verge of possibly disappearing altogether. Enter the two Hollywood stars, and their dreams of bringing the club back to its former glory. Like a real-lifeTed Lasso, this docuseries follows the two as they begin to understand that what might have started as a lark is a literally game-changing turn for the players and people of Wrexham in reclaiming their storied sporting history. The series returned for a fourth season on May 15 and has a fifth season already in the works.Watch on HuluThe Handmaid’s TaleWhen Margaret Atwood wroteThe Handmaid’s Talein 1985, little did she know that its television adaptation would revolutionize the still-nascent world of original streaming content. And she may not have anticipated just how many parallels her dystopian classic would share with the real world at the time it was adapted into an award-winning television series. It’s set in an unnamed time in what is presumably the very near future, when the United States has been taken over by a fundamentalist group known as Gilead, under whose regime women are considered property and stripped of any personal rights. The most valuable women are those who are fertile, as infertility has become an epidemic, and they are kept as handmaids who are forced to take part in sexual rituals with high-ranking couples in order to bear their children. Recognizing the power she wields, Offred, aka June Osborne (Elisabeth Moss), is not content to remain enslaved and sets about changing the rules as she seeks to reunite with her lost husband and daughter, becoming romantically entangled with a Gilead Guardian (Max Minghella) in the process.The Handmaid’s Tale'ssixth, and final, season arrived on April 8.Watch on HuluDying for SexFive-time Oscar nominee Michelle Williams plays Molly Kochan, a young woman trapped in a loveless marriage who learns that she has terminal stage IV breast cancer. After revealing that she has never had an orgasm with another person, it becomes apparent to Molly and everyone caring for her that this should be at the top of her bucket list. Realizing she doesn’t have much time left, Molly leaves her husband and, with the help of her best friend Nikki (Jenny Slate), sets out to achieve the sexual satisfaction that has eluded her all her life—with unexpected consequences.New Girlcreator ​​Liz Meriwether teamed up with Kim Rosenstock (Only Murders in the Building) to create this hit new series, which is based on the life of the real Molly Kochan, creator of theDying for Sexpodcast, which launched in 2020.Watch on HuluBig BoysCreator Jack Rooke won a well-deserved BAFTA Award in 2024 for this semi-autobiographical dramedy about a closeted 19-year-old—also named Jack (Dylan Llewellyn)—who, after a year of mourning the death of his father at home with his overprotective mom, leaves for university. There, he’s paired up with Danny (Jon Pointing), a 25-year-old more interested in meeting women than studying, as his roommate. As Jack struggles to become comfortable with his sexuality, he also comes to understand the truth behind Danny’s seemingly extroverted personality. Yes, it’s a coming-of-age story and one in which opposites attract (on a purely platonic level). But it’s also a laugh-out-loud funny series that shows there is life after death.Watch on HuluDeli BoysPakistani American brothers Mir (Asif Ali) and Raj (Saagar Shaikh) Dar have spent their entire lives wanting for nothing, thanks to the hard work of their father, who owns a chain of convenience stores. But after a freak accident kills dear old dad, the brothers are expected to take on the family business which, unbeknownst to them, is actually a front for a drug smuggling empire. While their antics are undoubtedly hilarious, the series does attempt to paint a truthful portrait of the immigrant experience—even if it’s often through an absurdist lens.Watch on HuluA Thousand BlowsIf Netflix’sAdolescencehas you seeking out more of Stephen Graham’s work, check out Steven Knight’sA Thousand Blows—thePeaky Blinderscreator’s newest British historical drama in which crime and violence collide. In this case it’s an all-female crime syndicate, the Forty Elephants, who are at the center of the action, with Mary Carr (Erin Doherty) as their leader. When Mary’s crew crosses notorious kingpin Sugar Goodson (Graham), she turns to Hezekiah Moscow (Malachi Kirby) and Alec Munroe (Francis Lovehall), two young men who have recently emigrated from Jamaica in order to make a better life for themselves, to help her escape Goodson’s wrath.Watch on HuluDevil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby FrankeIn 2015, thirtysomething Mormon mom of six Ruby Franke became one of YouTube’s most popular mommy vloggers with her channel,8 Passengers. But as Franke’s popularity grew, so too did questions surrounding her punishment-prone style of parenting. Eight years later, Franke’s 12-year-old son showed up at a stranger’s door—looking emaciated and covered in open wounds and duct tape—asking the man to call the police as he was being abused. Franke’s roller-coaster ride from “perfect” mom to child abuser has been making headlines for years, but this three-part docuseries goes behind the scenes with exclusive interviews and footage that shed new light on the truth behind the tragedy.Watch on HuluParadiseThis Is Uscreator Dan Fogelman reteams with that award-winning series’ star, Sterling K. Brown, for an intricate political thriller which plays with time to slowly reveal the details of a secret service agent (Brown) tasked with protecting the president (James Marsden) who ultimately becomes a suspect in the POTUS’ death. Expect many twists—including a massive one to kick off the series in episode 1. A second season is already in the works and expected to premiere in early 2026.Watch on HuluScamanda“Why would somebody fake cancer?” That’s the question asked—and that ABC News attempts to answer—in this true crime docuseries based on the podcast of the same name. The four-part special recounts the life and lies of Amanda C. Riley, a wife, mother, churchgoer, and popular mommy blogger who was celebrated for sharing her fight against Hodgkin’s lymphoma with the world … only to have it all blow up in her face.Watch on HuluAccusedLike a reverse engineered version ofLaw & Order,Accused—adapted byHomelandcocreator Howard Gordon from the acclaimed British series of the same name—follows the justice system from the perspective of the accused. Each episode begins with the defendant in the courtroom and recounts (via flashbacks) the circumstances that led them there. Like Dick Wolf’s iconic crime series, each episode is full of familiar faces, from Whitney Cummings and Wendell Pierce to Molly Parker and Margo Martindale.Watch on HuluSay NothingFact and fiction combine in this historical drama based on Patrick Radden Keefe’s novel that follows the lives of a group of people growing up in Belfast during the Troubles and their dealings with the Provisional IRA. Much of the story focuses on the Disappeared—a group of 16 people who went missing during the Troubles and were believed to have been kidnapped and murdered. Jean McConville was one of these individuals, both the only woman among them and the only Irish Catholic convert. Nearly 50 years later, many questions remain about these individuals. WhileSay Nothingdoesn’t attempt to answer all of these questions, it does add fascinating context to the events.Watch on HuluInterior ChinatownWillis Wu (Jimmy O. Yang) is a waiter who attempts to escape his humdrum life by imagining that he is a background actor in aLaw & Order-esque TV show calledBlack & White. After Wu witnesses a kidnapping, police detective Lana Lee (Chloe Bennet) enlists him to help investigate and take down the local gangs in Chinatown—where he discovers something about his own family in the process. Nothing is what it seems in this meta comedy-crime series, which Charles Yu adapted from his own National Book Award–winning novel.The Daily Show’s Ronny Chieng ups the comedy as Wu’s coworker/BFF Fatty Choi, and Taika Waititi (one of the show’s executive producers) directs the pilot.Watch on HuluWhat We Do in the ShadowsIf you are in need of a laugh-out-loud comedy (and don’t mind if it’s of the sometimes R-rated kind), there are few better thanWhat We Do in the Shadows. In 2014, Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi cowrote, codirected, and costarred in a feature of the same name—a funny mockumentary featuring a group of vampires who share a home. This series, which premiered in 2019, moved the vampire action from New Zealand to Staten Island and brought in a whole new group of vampires—who struggle to even get up off the couch, let alone take over all of New York City (as they’ve been instructed to). After several years, they finally seem ready to get around to the task. All six seasons of the series, which wrapped up its run in December, are available for streaming.Watch on HuluLa MáquinaGael García Bernal andDiego Lunahave been close friends since childhood, and it shows in the work they’ve done together—most famously inAlfonso Cuarón’sOscar-nominatedY Tu Mamá También(2001). More than two decades later, their onscreen chemistry is still potent, as evidenced by this Spanish-language boxing drama. Esteban (Bernal) is an aging boxer whose manager/BFF Andy (Luna) persuades him to step into the ring one last time before he officially retires. But as the match looms closer, the criminal underbelly of the sport rears its head—forcing Esteban to determine what parts of his life he’s willing to sacrifice. With just six episodes in all,La Máquinamoves fast. Don’t flinch.Watch on HuluHow to Die AloneFormerSaturday Night LiveandInsecurewriter Natasha Rothwell—whom you might know from her Emmy-nominated turn as spa manager Belinda in seasons 1 and 3 ofThe White Lotus—created and stars in this eight-episode series. Mel (Rothwell) is an employee at New York City’s JFK Airport who is content with the uneventful life she has built for herself. But when she has a sudden brush with death, she decides to take her life into her own hands. While it’s not the first series to explore matters of life and death, it does so in a way that is both beautifully nuanced and laugh-out-loud funny—all of it anchored by Rothwell’s performance. On February 4,Hulu announcedthat it had canceled the series after one season—a move that has Rothwell “baffled” and looking for a new network to produce season 2.Watch on HuluEnglish TeacherTelevision audiences are hardly lacking in high school–set comedies, or in really great high school–set comedies, and/or really great high school–set comedies that focus on the teacher perspective (see:Abbott Elementary).English Teacherfits into that elite niche. Brian Jordan Alvarez—who was behind the award-winning 2016 web seriesThe Gay and Wondrous Life of Caleb Gallo—both created and stars in the show, in which he portrays an English teacher in Austin, Texas, who is dedicated to making an impact on his students, even if he sometimes needs to depend on their teenage wisdom to figure out the right way to do that. While it doesn’t shy away from the politics that exist in the teaching profession, the series—which has already been renewed for another season—also presents the “adults” as often just as lost as the kids they teach.Watch on HuluOnly Murders in the BuildingSteve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez make for a delightful trio of true-crime-obsessed podcast fans who, in season 1 of this original Hulu series, decide to join forces and create their own podcast while attempting to solve the mysterious death of a fellow resident of their Manhattan apartment building. From the very beginning of their odd alliance, it’s been clear that all is not what it seems, and everyone is keeping secrets. Now they’ve upped the ante on guest stars, too; the third season saw Paul Rudd and Meryl Streep join in the fun. Streep returned for the show’s fourth season, and was joined by Eugene Levy, Kumail Nanjiani, Tina Fey, Melissa McCarthy, Zach Galifianakis, and Eva Longoria. Season 5 is already in the works, with Renée Zellweger, Christoph Waltz, and Keegan-Michael Key, Téa Leoni, Logan Lerman, and Beanie Feldstein among the already-confirmed guest stars. It’s expected to premiere in October 2025.Watch on HuluSolar OppositesThis animated sci-fi comedy, which premiered in 2020, is about a family of aliens from the planet Shlorp who crash-land on Earth—for better or worse. The show is rooted in the idea that humans are, well, weird. Which seems appropriate given this current moment in time. Yet, in between the laughs and occasional threat to humanity, it maintains a positive outlook on the world and the people who inhabit it. Which is something we could probably all use right about now. The show’s sixth season, which is expected to premiere in the fall, will also be its last.Watch on HuluFuturamaFollowing a decade-long hiatus,Futurama—Matt Groening and David X. Cohen’s animated sci-fi comedy—made a triumphant return in 2023, complete with gags aboutTwilight Zoneand “Momazon” drone deliveries. Now is the perfect time to dive back in—or watch it all for the first time. All 12 seasons of the series are currently available for streaming and Hulu has confirmed that at least two more seasons are on the way (with the next one tentatively scheduled to premiere as early as July).Watch on HuluWe Were the Lucky OnesIn Radom, Poland, the Kurcs are a loving family who seem to have it all—until the horrors of the Holocaust invade the serenity of their everyday lives. As World War II arrives on their doorstep, the family is separated—escaping to France, Brazil, West Africa, and Russia. Some are in hiding, others in concentration camps. But they’re all focused on one goal: surviving the war and reuniting with each other.Watch on HuluThe BearCarmen “Carmy” Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) is a superstar of the fine dining world who has returned to his hometown of Chicago to save his family’s struggling sandwich shop after his brother’s death by suicide. While Carmy initially struggles to acclimate himself to being home and to his inherited kitchen’s back-to-basics style, he eventually realizes that it’s not too late to change both himself and the restaurant. Anyone who has ever worked in a busy kitchen knows the stress that comes with it, andThe Beardoes an excellent job of making that tension palpable—as evidenced by its slew of aforementioned Emmy Awards. While the plot sounds simple enough, much of Carmy’s previous life is a bit of a mystery, and it’s doled out in amuse-bouche-sized bits throughout the series with top-tier guest stars you may not have seen coming (fact: Jamie Lee Curtis has never been better, as evidenced by her recent—and very first—Emmy win).The Bearwill return for a fourth season on June 25. Prepare to feast.Watch on HuluQueenieQueenie Jenkins (Dionne Brown) is a Jamaican-British twentysomething whose world is thrown into an upheaval following an ugly breakup with her boyfriend. That messiness follows Queenie into the next chapter in her life, when she attempts to pick up the pieces of her failed relationship while frequently butting heads with her family and trying to reconcile her dual cultures. Candice Carty-Williams adapts her own bestselling novel to create a poignant dramedy that’s ultimately about trauma and healing.Watch on HuluBlack Twitter: A People’s HistoryIn the late 2000s—back when Elon Musk was just that car-and-spaceship billionaire—Twitter was more than a social media network. It was a genuine gathering place for people to find their people, whether that was Film Twitter or Cat Twitter. For Black Twitter, it was a lot more. This three-part docuseries, based on WIRED senior writerJason Parham’s 2021 cover story, recounts the most important moments and movements that helped solidify the Black Twitter community’s place as a cultural force in the world, from politics and beyond.Watch on HuluUnder the BridgeRiley Keough and Lily Gladstone (who earned an Emmy nomination for her work in the show) make a formidable duo as an author and a police officer, respectively, investigating the brutal murder of a 14-year-old girl in a small town in Canada. The limited series is based on Rebecca Godfrey’s award-winning 2005 book of the same name (with Keough portraying Godfrey), and is a haunting reminder of what human beings are capable of.Watch on HuluShōgunGame of Thronesfans still lamenting the loss of one of television's great epics have found their new favorite binge-watch inShōgun,which took home a record 18 Emmys (with 25 nods altogether) in 2024. This 10-episode series, based on James Clavell’s beloved novel (which was first adapted into a miniseries in 1980), is a brilliant and sweeping tale of political rivalry in feudal Japan where Lord Yoshii Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada), a powerful warrior, has a target put on his back by his political rivals in the Council of Regents. Fortunately for Toranaga, he’s got Toda Mariko (Anna Sawai), a talented translator and fiercely loyal samurai, by his side.Shōgunwas originally positioned as a one-and-done limited series, but FX and Hulu have already confirmed that two more seasons are in the works, with the next expected to arrive in 2027.Watch on HuluSuch Brave GirlsComedian/actress Kat Sadler created and stars in this deeply messy, darkly funny story of a totally dysfunctional family—mom Deb (Sherlock’s Louise Brealey) and daughters Josie (Sadler) and Billie (Lizzie Davidson, Sadler’s real-life sister)—attempting to pick up the pieces after their husband/father leaves them. It’s cringe-comedy at its finest, and the kind that will appeal to fans ofFleabag. A second season is in the works, and expected to premiere later this year.Watch on HuluAbbott ElementaryQuinta Brunson created and stars in this hit series, which follows the daily lives—in and out of the classroom—of a group of teachers at what is widely considered one of the worst public schools in America. Despite a lack of funding for even basic educational necessities, and school district leaders who only care about the barest minimum standards, these educators are united by their drive to surpass expectations and encourage their students to do the same. The series concluded its fourth season on April 16, with season 5 already confirmed.Watch on HuluFargoNoah Hawley’s anthology series isn’t the first attempt to adapt the Coen brothers’ Oscar-winning crime-comedy to the small screen (Edie Falco starred in a previous version, which was a more straightforward adaptation of the movie), but his approach was clearly the smarter move. Fans of the Coens in general will find lots to love about the many nods to the filmmakers’ entire filmography, with each season covering a different crime and time period. Though the seasons do share connections, each one is a total one-off, and the show might boast the most talented group of actors ever assembled: Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman, Bob Odenkirk, Oliver Platt, Ted Danson, Patrick Wilson, Nick Offerman, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, Ewan McGregor, Michael Stuhlbarg, Carrie Coon, Scoot McNairy, Chris Rock, Jason Schwartzman, Timothy Olyphant, and Ben Whishaw are just a few of the names who’ve found a home inFargo. The fantastic fifth season—featuring Juno Temple, Jon Hamm, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Joe Keery, and Lamorne Morris (who won an Emmy for his role)—continued this tradition of exceptional acting, with all episodes streaming now.Watch on HuluA Murder at the End of the WorldDarby Hart (Emma Corrin) is a talented hacker and armchair detective who is one of eight guests invited to spend a few days at the stunning yet remote home of a mysterious billionaire (Clive Owen). When one of the guests ends up dead, Darby must work quickly to prove that it was murder—and who did it—before the bodies start piling up. Fans of twisty true crime will appreciate this limited series, which comes from the minds of Brit Marling (who costars) and Zal Batmanglij—cocreators of the equally mind-bendingThe OA.Watch on HuluMoonlightingWhileDie Hardturned Bruce Willis into one of Hollywood’s biggest action stars, he was far from producers’ first choice for the role of John McClane. That’s largely because he was seen as the funny guy fromMoonlighting, the Emmy-winning ’80s dramedy that centers around the Blue Moon Detective Agency and its two often-bickering owners, David Addison (Willis) and Maddie Hayes (Cybill Shepherd). Over the course of its five seasons, the series racked up some serious critical acclaim and wasn’t afraid to experiment with the sitcom format.Watch on HuluThe Other Black GirlSinclair Daniel shines as Nella Rogers, an up-and-coming book editor—and the only Black employee at the publishing house where she works. While Nella is initially thrilled when another young woman of color, Hazel-May McCall (Ashleigh Murray), is hired as an assistant, she can’t help but notice that a series of bizarre events seems to follow. As Nella tries to suss out exactly what is going on, she uncovers some pretty damn disturbing skeletons in her employer’s closet. While horror-comedies are an increasingly popular movie genre, we don’t see them on the small screen quite as often—which, if this clever series is any indication, is a real shame. Also unfortunate: One season is all we’ll get ofThe Other Black Girl.Watch on HuluThe Full MontyTwenty-six years after a low-budget British comedy blew up at the box office, scored an Oscar, and introduced “the Full Monty” into the popular lexicon, the Regular Joes turned strippers from Sheffield are back to face largely the same issues they were lamenting in the original feature film (which is alsostreaming on Hulu). Much of the main cast reassembled for this follow-up to Peter Cattaneo’s hit 1997 movie, including two-time Oscar nominee Tom Wilkinson, who passed away in late December. Stripping is involved, as are other inevitables in life, including breakups, reconciliations, and death. For fans of the original movie—or the Broadway musical and stage play that followed—it’s a fun check-in with the characters who bared it all.Watch on HuluThe Office(UK)Years before there was Jim and Pam and Dwight and Michael, there were Tim and Dawn and Gareth and David. For lovers of cringe, it’s hard to do better than Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant’s workplace comedy. David Brent (Gervais) is the original boss from hell, whose office antics will have you covering your eyes and laughing out loud at the same time. Like many British series, there are just two seasons—each consisting of a mere six episodes—plus a two-part Christmas special. Don’t be surprised if you sit down to watch a single episode and binge it all in one go.Watch on HuluCheersIn the 1980s, NBC was the channel to watch on Thursday nights—in large part thanks toCheers. The bar where everybody knows your name is where the action happens in this award-winning sitcom about a former Red Sox player (Ted Danson) and the lovable employees and patrons who treat his bar like a second home. If you can look past (or, even better, embrace) the questionable ’80s fashion and sometimes-sexist storylines that wouldn’t necessarily fly on TV today, you’ll find what is arguably one of the smartest sitcoms ever written. More than 40 years after its original premiere, the jokes still stand up and the characters are some of television’s most memorable (and beloved) for a reason.Watch on HuluDopesickBack in 2021, Hulu went where Netflix’sPainkillerwent in 2023: to the late ’90s and early 2000s, aka the beginning of America’s opioid crisis. Danny Strong created this retelling of the lengths to which Richard Sackler (played here by the always excellent Michael Stuhlbarg) and Purdue Pharma would go to sell doctors on the powers of OxyContin—all with the promise of no addiction. Michael Keaton won an Emmy for his portrayal of a widowed doctor in Appalachia who buys into the lies, and eventually becomes a victim of them.Watch on HuluReservation DogsTaika Waititi and Sterlin Harjo cocreated this Peabody Award–winning series, which made history as the first mainstream TV show created by, starring, and crewed by an almost entirely Indigenous American team. It tells the story of four bored teens who are desperate to escape their lives on a reservation in Oklahoma. They decide that California is where they want to be and commit to a life of mostly petty crimes in order to save up enough money to leave. The full three seasons are available to watch now, including the brilliant series sendoff.Watch on HuluThe GreatElle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult shine in this witty, fast-paced, comedic retelling (but not really) of Catherine the Great’s rise to power. Created by Tony McNamara, who earned Oscar nominations for his writing work on bothThe FavouriteandPoor Things,The Greatoffers the same combination of lush costumes and scenery mixed with a biting commentary on the world, and a woman’s place in it. A story that rings as true today as it did in the 18th century, when Catherine the Great became empress of Russia and brought about the Age of Enlightenment, this show chips away at notions of class, propriety, and monarchical rule in a way few others do. If it’s historical accuracy you’re after, look elsewhere; the series’ creators describe it as decidedly “anti-historical” (which is part of the fun). All three seasons are available to stream.Watch on HuluTiny Beautiful ThingsThe reason to watch this eight-part limited series can be summed up in two words: Kathryn Hahn. Acomedic juggernaut, Hahn can switch from funny to dramatic in the same scene, if not the same sentence. This talent is on display inTiny Beautiful Things, where she plays Claire, a writer who takes up an advice column and pours all the traumas of her life into responding to her readers. Based onWildauthor Cheryl Strayed’scollectionof “Dear Sugar” columns, the vignettes here may be a bit out of sorts, but Hahn pulls them together.Watch on HuluDaveDave Burd is a comedian and rapper who goes by the stage name Lil Dicky. InDave, Burd plays a rapper who goes by the stage name Lil Dicky and is attempting to raise his profile and make a much bigger name for himself. If only his many neuroses didn’t keep getting in the way. WhileDavecould have easily turned into some mediocre experiment in meta storytelling, Burd—who cocreated the series, stars in it, and has written several episodes—grapples with some surprisingly touchy topics, including mental illness. And he does it all with a level of sensitivity and honesty that you might not expect from a guy named Lil Dicky. Despite the show’s popularity and critical acclaim, the three seasons currently streaming may be all we get ofDave. In early 2024, Burd announced that he’d be pressing “pause” on the series in order to explore other creative ventures. (But never say never.)Watch on HuluAtlantaDonald Glover proved himself to be a quadruple threat of an actor, writer, musician, and comedian with this highly acclaimed FX series about Earnest “Earn” Marks (Glover), an aspiring music manager who is trying to help his cousin Alfred Miles, aka Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry), kick off his musical career. They’re surrounded by a supportive crew of friends, including Alfred’s BFF, Darius (LaKeith Stanfield), and Van (Zazie Beetz), Earn’s close friend and the mother of his child. This makes it all sound like a fairly straightforward buddy comedy, butAtlantais so much more. Even better: It’s weird. Glover is not afraid to experiment with storytelling, which is part of what makes the show so compelling.Watch on HuluBasketsZach Galifianakis stars alongside Zach Galifianakis as twin brothers Chip and Dale Baskets in this unexpectedly moving family comedy about an aspiring clown (Chip) who fails to graduate from a fancy clowning school in Paris and is forced to return home to Bakersfield, California, where he lives with his mother (the late Louie Anderson) and is constantly belittled by his higher-achieving brother (Dale). Between the dual role for Galifianakis and Anderson as the mom, it may sound like a cheap bit of stunt casting that can’t sustain more than an episode, let alone multiple character arcs. But if you’re a fan of absurdist comedy,Basketstruly ranks among the best of them. And Anderson, who won his first and only Emmy for his role as Costco-loving Christine, is absolutely transcendent. While it received a fair amount of critical acclaim,Basketscould rightly be considered one of the most underseen and underappreciated series in recent memory.Watch on HuluThe DropoutAmanda Seyfried won a much deserved Outstanding Lead Actress Emmy for her portrayal of the notorious Stanford dropout turned health care technology maven Elizabeth Holmes, whotrickedsome of the world’s savviest business minds into investing in her company, Theranos. While Holmes’ goal was altruistic enough—making health care more accessible to the masses via a device that could detect any number of diseases with little more than a single finger prick of blood—the technology wasn’t able to catch up. Rather than admit defeat, she kept pushing, making business deals and promises she could never fulfill.Watch on HuluIt’s Always Sunny in PhiladelphiaIf you thought the characters onSeinfeldwere terrible people, wait until you meet the gang from Paddy’s Pub. For nearly 20 years, Dennis (Glenn Howerton), Mac (Robert McElhenney), Charlie (Charlie Day), Sweet Dee (Kaitlin Olson), and Frank (Danny DeVito) have unapologetically plotted against each other and total strangers in a series of completely self-centered schemes with absolutely no regard for the rules of civility. The show follows the “no hugging and no learning” rule Larry David established forSeinfeld, but elevates it to a new level of sociopathy. “Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,” “Sweet Dee Has a Heart Attack,” “How Mac Got Fat,” “Dennis Looks Like a Registered Sex Offender,” “The Gang Turns Black,” and “The Gang Goes to a Water Park” are just some of the offbeat adventures awaiting viewers. In 2021,Sunnybecame thelongest-running live-action sitcomin the history of television, and it shows no signs of slowing down—or taking it easy on its characters. It also happens to be one of the easiest shows to binge: Pop an episode on and, without even realizing it, you’ll be on to another season. Its 16th (!!) wrapped up in 2023—but there are at least two more on the way, with the next one set to arrive in June.Watch on HuluLetterkennyWhat began as a web series is now a Hulu original that wrapped up its eleventh season in December. The show is a portrait of small-town Canada (the fictional Letterkenny of the title) and focuses on siblings Wayne (cocreator Jared Keeso) and Katy (Michelle Mylett), who run a produce stand with help from friends Daryl (Nathan Dales) and Squirrely Dan (K. Trevor Wilson). As is often the case in small-town series, many of the residents fall into specific categories—inLetterkenny, you could be a gym rat, a hick, a skid (their word for a drug addict), or a “native” (a member of the nearby First Nation reservation). But in contrast to many small-town series, these groups—and the individuals who comprise them—aren’t reduced to meaningless stereotypes.Watch on HuluPen15Mining the awkwardness of one’s middle school years is hardly a new comedy concept. But being in your early thirties and playing yourself as a junior high school student and then surrounding yourself with age-appropriate actors who are actually going through that hellish rite of passage brings a whole new layer of cringe and humor. This is exactly what cocreators/stars Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle did forPen15.Watch on Hulu",

    "content": "Save this storySaveSave this storySaveTrump Media andTechnology Group, a publicly traded company in which US president Donald Trump and his family own a majority stake, has raised $2.5 billion to accumulate a “bitcoin treasury.”On Monday, in response toa reportby the Financial Times, TMTG initially denied contemplating any such maneuver. “The Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources,” the company reportedly said. But Trump Media and Technology Group appears to have since changed its tune.In apress releaseon Tuesday, TMTG confirmed that it has agreed to sell $1.5 billion worth of equity and take on a further $1 billion in debt—and plans to use the proceeds to add vast quantities of bitcoin to its balance sheet.The deal puts TMTG in competition with a growing stable of bitcoin accumulation stocks, which act as a substitute of sorts for investing in bitcoin, without investors having tohandle crypto themselves. In theory, as the price of bitcoin rises and falls, so should the stock price of the companies with large bitcoin treasuries.\"We view bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets,” said TMTG CEO Devin Nunes in a statement. “It's a big step forward in the company's plans to evolve into a holding company by acquiring additional profit-generating, crown jewel assets consistent with America First principles.”TMTG’s embrace of crypto represents a small part of a more elaborate picture: Within the past year, Trump and his family have forged into almost every segment of the crypto market, despite a chorus of complaints relating to allegedabuses of officeandconflicts of interest.In January, in the days leading up to the inauguration, Trump and his wife Melania bothissued their own crypto coins, adding billions of dollars to their paper net worth. That same month, TMTG announced thelaunch ofTruth.Fi, its new fintech division, which partnered shortly thereafterwith crypto exchangeCrypto.com with a view to offering crypto-related investment products to the public. The president’s sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. meanwhile, have promoted a separate crypto services company,World Liberty Financial, and recently established a bitcoin mining business, American Bitcoin.The crypto ventures associated with the Trump family have raised hundreds of millions of dollars—partly byselling crypto coinsto the investing public and partly by acquiring assets indeals cut with business partners.“Look back at some of Donald Trump’s ventures over time … he essentially brings the marketing and a built-in audience in return for a relatively large cut,” says Austin Campbell, adjunct professor at NYU Stern School of Business and managing partner at crypto consultancy Zero Knowledge. “American Bitcoin is literally that playbook.”In May, Eric Trumpannouncedplans to take American Bitcoin public. Like TMTG, the company intends to accrue a large bitcoin treasury and turn itself into a bitcoin accumulation stock. \"Our vision for American Bitcoin is to create the most investable bitcoin accumulation platform in the market,\" he said when he announced the plan.Despite the ready availability ofbitcoin exchange-traded funds,a cheaper way to invest in the currency indirectly, bitcoin treasury stocks are proliferating. Within the past two months, figures includingBrandon Lutnick, the son of US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, andDavid Bailey, a bitcoin evangelist who reportedlyadvised Trumpon crypto policy, have launched their own respective bitcoin treasury vehicles. TwoNasdaq-listedcompanieswith links to China also recently raised hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire a combination of bitcoin and Trump’s own crypto coin.Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), a publicly traded software company that hasaccumulated a bitcoin treasuryworth $63 billion, has long traded at a value that far exceeds its bitcoin holdings.“MicroStrategy was the first large acquirer of bitcoin as a public company. It has been the best performing stock of any other on the public market since that first bitcoin purchase. Naturally, other companies are attracted to that return profile,” says Bill Papanastasiou, director of equity research at analyst house KBW.Whether the Trump family is able to replicate that success—either through TMTG or American Bitcoin—will depend on its ability to parlay its brand and public standing into continued attention, commentators predict.“If you look at the history of these trends, the original tends to do very well and direct copycats tend to do poorly,” says Campbell. “MicroStrategy worked because there is a cult of personality around [executive chairman] Michael Saylor. Whether it’s going to work for all these other companies, we’ll see … We’ve come full circle to the branding value of Trump.”",

Easy to pitch once you figure it out. Only need one trekking pole. Reasonably priced.TIREDCondensation can be an issue. Zippers are flimsy.Finding the righttent for a backpacking trip is always tricky. You have to balance packed size and weight against livability and how well it stands up to wind and rain. I've always erred on the side ofa sturdy tentover any weight concerns, which is why I lovethe Hilleberg Akto, but I don't alwaysneedthe Akto.There is a short season in my neck of the woods called summer, when storms are less likely and temps don't drop much below the 60s. This is when I've been using the Lunar Solo, Six Moon Design's flagship ultralight one-person tent. After several late and early summer trips around the north woods of Wisconsin and Michigan, it has proved itself a capable shelter. It weighs just 2 pounds, packs down quite small, and checks a whole lot of other boxes on my tent wish list.Plenty of SpacePhotograph: Scott GilbertsonThere is no one tent to rule them all, and trying to find one is a mistake. You're better off with two tents, knowing the limitations of each and using each when it's the best for the job. Which is to say, I love the Akto, but I also think Six Moon Design's Lunar Solo is excellent for summer trips when you prize traveling light over withstanding intense storms.That's not to say the Lunar Solo won't keep you dry. It will. The silicone polyester fabric, or Sil Poly, is plenty waterproof, though you'll either need to seam-seal it yourself with someSeam Grip, or have the Six Moon Designs team do it for you before they ship it, which costs $35. My testing tent arrived seam-sealed, but being old enough to remember when you had to seam-seal just about every tent, I've done it enough times to say it's not hard should you choose to DIY it.The Lunar Solo is single-wall, single-pole tent intended to be pitched with a trekking pole. This makes for a very small and light tent but also has two potential drawbacks: structural integrity and condensation. More on those in a moment. Once pitched, the Lunar Solo offers 26 square feet of living space and a peak height of 49 inches, and the vestibule offers 8.5 square feet of additional gear storage. Overall I found the Lunar Solo to be plenty spacious for one person with gear. The rear wall expands out slightly, giving you a place to stash frequently needed items without pushing them up against the tent wall.The 20D silnylon and mesh walls feel as durable as anything you'll find at this weight, unless you want to go with a Cuben Fiber/Dyneema tent, but to my mind the high price of Cuben puts it in a different category. The floor of the Lunar Solo is a more robust 40-denier (40D), and has a bathtub shape to help ensure water doesn't get in. The rear of the Lunar Solo has a 6-inch mesh portion between the floor and the main wall that helps with ventilation.Any single pole tent is going to struggle in wind, no matter how many guyline points it offers. I did find the Lunar Solo compressed a good deal when I pitched it in high winds on the exposed shores of Lake Superior. It was admittedly not a great campsite from a seeking-shelter point of view, not one I would pick if I wasn't testing the wind resistance of a tent. But it did convince me that the Lunar Solo needs either a trekking pole or a heavier tent pole thanthe ultralight poleSix Moon Design provided. (I did a good portion of my testing while bikepacking so I didn't have trekking poles.)I eventually made a more robust pole from a couple of thicker (albeit, heavier) pole segments I had lying around. While I did not get a chance to repeat the wind test, I feel like this combo, which is what I used the rest of the time testing the Lunar Solo, would have held up fine. Most backpackers will use trekking poles to pitch the Lunar Solo, which will provide a much stronger pitch.It's important you pitch the Lunar Solo correctly, which is a little tricky at first. I highly suggest practicing in ideal conditions before you hit the trail so you can get a feel for it without the added stress of rain. Six Moon Designs has someinstructions on its site, which I highly recommend reading. The Lunar Solo pitches with six stakes for the base, two at each end, one for the back, one for the vestibule. The method I found that works best is to stake out the three rear stakes to form a nice taut triangle. Once that's done, I put in the pole to raise the tent up, then stake out the vestibule tension line and put in the remaining two side stakes. Once I came up with this system, I found I could get a good pitch in just a few minutes.One thing worth emphasizing is that you don't want to try to keep the stakes high up to match the height of the tent off the ground. Use the guylines to handle the height difference and put your stakes all the way in the ground. This will make the Lunar Solo much stronger.Wet MorningsPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonThe Lunar Solo is what Six Moon Designs calls a hybrid single-wall tent. Technically, it is double-walled since it has a mesh door and mesh around the floor. But the sides and back of the tent are single-walled and thus vulnerable to condensation. Condensation happens in all tents to varying degrees depending on conditions, but single-wall tents put the condensation on the wall you're going to touch, making the consequences considerably higher. Waking up with water dripping on your face, or ina sleeping bagthat's been rendered a sopping mess by condensation, is no fun.The Lunar Solo attempts to manage condensation the only way you can—by offering a variety of ways to ventilate the tent, reducing humidity (at least the part you're creating) in the process. The Lunar Solo has a vent at the top of the vestibule, the entire door is mesh, and there's mesh all the way around the base, all of which do help with ventilation.The fly does not reach all the way to floor, allowing more airflow, and the vestibule can be raised up when it's not raining to increase the effectiveness of the front mesh. Unfortunately, whether all this is enough to eliminate condensation depends entirely on the conditions you're in. If the humidity outside is high enough, all the ventilation in the world won't stop condensation.I did not have a huge issue with condensation in the Lunar Solo, save one scenario—wind after a rain. I carried a small microfiber towel which I used to wipe off condensation in the mornings, and for the most part this kept things under control. One night last fall though, it rained for hours and then the wind picked up and shook a good bit of condensation off the tent walls onto me and my sleeping bag.A Backpacking BargainThe Lunar Solo is a capable tent that doesn't weigh much and for $260 is a bargain. The nearest competitor is probably theZpacks Plex Solo Lite, which has a very similar design but is made of Dyneema Composite Fabrics (DCF) and more than twice the price. I haven't tested the Plex Solo, but I have used other DCF tents and I am not a fan. Like all Dyneema, it crinkles loudly. I much prefer the packability and relative silence of silnylon.The other interesting competitor is theDurston X-Mid 1. I have spent a few nights in an older model, but the X-Mid 1 wasrecently redesignedwith 15D walls, and a slightly larger interior. The X-Mid 1 is a double-walled tent, which I consider an advantage, but it does require two poles and the max height is only 41 inches to the Lunar Solo's 49 inches. I'm hoping to get a chance to test the new X-Mid 1 this summer.The Lunar Solo is tough to beat, though I do wish Six Moon Designs would use heavier zippers. I'd happily carry a couple extra ounces to have more robust zippers. The mesh front wall does limit it more to summer trips, but the Lunar Solo is a great option for those who want to travel light in the backcountry.Update May 28, 2025: A previous version of this review referred to the fabric as sil nylon. It is actually sil poly and we have corrected that.$260at Garage Grown Gear$260at Six Moon Designs",

Does it live up to its 'professional' price tag?Written byChris Bayer,EditorMay 29, 2025 at 2:30 a.m. PTZDNET's key takeawaysValerion's VisionMaster Pro 2 retails for $2,999.This premium-built laser TV projects up to a 300-inch screen.It's still not ideal for brightly lit rooms (like all projectors).$2,999 at Amazonmay / 2025I chose the word \"glorious\" in the headline for this review because that word sprang to mind when I first laid eyes on theVisionMaster Pro 2projector from Valerion -- and that was before I even plugged it in.Valerion, a sister company to Awol Vision, is just over a year old, and it's already helping to redefine what's possible for big-screen entertainment at home. In fact, Valerion's packaging promises to \"bring Hollywood to your home\" with professional-grade specs and features. Granted, this level of quality doesn't come cheap.Also:I replaced my 4K TV with a $350 tri-fold projector for a week - here's my buying advice nowBut how does the Pro 2 perform, and is it worth the hefty price tag? I was eager to dive right in and find out.Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2 Laser TVValerion VisionMaster Pro 2 Laser TVdetailsView at AmazonFirst impressions on design and buildHonestly, I'd have to award the Valerion Pro 2 with the \"Best looking\" superlative over any projector I've reviewed. Its design features metallic fins that wrap around a black chassis, giving it a distinctive, modern, high aesthetic. Behind those reflective fins, the left and right sides house both heat dissipation vents and speakers, with neither being a conspicuous part of the construction. The facade of the model I tested gleams in both bright and dark environments, and the whole thing looks as if it's made of smoked glass.The Pro 2 measures 10.2 x 7.3 x 8.5 inches and is compact, somewhat rectangular, but mostly cuboid. Despite its glossy exterior, the build is stalwart and dense, weighing over 15 pounds. In its nifty, galvanized polyethylene foam carrying case, the Pro 2 weighs 22 pounds. Portable and well-protected, yes, but not super lightweight. Here, I should mention that this is not an ultra-short-throw (UST) projector.Also:Hisense's latest laser projector is so sharp and vivid, it may just replace your 4K TVI set it up at 10 feet from our lab's ALR screen, and it filled the 150-inch frame perfectly. Notably, the height at which I positioned the unit did not matter because its autofocus and keystone adjustments wereon time, producing a sharp, clear, and color-soaked picture instantaneously. The Pro 2 can be ceiling mounted, or it has a sturdy, swivable foot bar on the bottom for angling, should you need that. (I never did.)The VisionMaster Pro 2's remote is well-designed, and backlit!Chris Bayer/ZDNETThe Pro 2 supports a screen size ranging from 40 inches (at less than three feet from a wall) to a maximum of 300 inches diagonally at almost 33 feet away. That's justnuts. For scale, it would require a wall that's nearly 22 feet wide and over 12 feet tall. Assuming your home theatre setup isn't that big, you'll be getting a stellar viewing experience with the Pro 2.The attendant remote control is extremely well laid out, and it has three of my favorite features: it's backlit, it has a dedicated Mute button, and it arrived with two AAA batteries. Incidentally, it's also one of the prettiest remotes (of any device) I've ever handled.Operation, features, and picture qualityDespite my salivating over the VisionMaster's remote, it's not even essential for using the projector. If you set it up with Google Assistant, you can operate it completely hands-free. Even when the Pro 2 is turned off, you can wake it up with \"Hey Google, power on,\" and it immediately starts playing (as long as you've enabled the far-field button on top). Ask it the current temperature or what time it is in your location, and its familiar female voice will speak to you like any other Google device.Also:I changed 3 settings on my PS5 to significantly improve the performanceI didn't say it explicitly before, but unboxing and setting up the VisionMaster Pro 2 felt surprisingly plug-and-play for this kind of high-end tech. The three HDMI ports (one eARC) on its backside make it easy to connect to an Apple TV 4K, a Blu-ray player, a soundbar, or a PS5 or Nintendo Switch. Even without those peripherals, you're ready to rock with the Pro 2 once you've connected to Wi-Fi.I did state before that the initial alignment and focus are largely automated, which is lovely. Still, there is a litany of manual tweaks available for perfectionists in a labyrinth of menus and submenus. In fact, the Pro 2 has more options for tweaking very specific settings than just about any TV or projector I've seen.The Pro 2 has a wide array of connectivity ports.Adam Breeden/ZDNETOne such setting is called Enhanced Black Level (EBL). While I've heard minor complaints such as EBL introducing a green tint or brightness pumping, I found the feature to improve the appearance of everything I watched, and that included an 8K OLED color test on YouTube.Also:I replaced my TV with a 4K UST projector - and the visual upgrade was worth itWith the Pro 2 fired up, its brightness is the first thing that hits you. Valerion specs this unit at a robust 3,000 ISO lumens. In practical terms, this means you don't need a dedicated bat-cave to enjoy it. Our testing lab is proof of this because the Pro 2's projection was watchable -- vibrant even -- with the studio door open, oozing in ambient light.We even clicked on a down-facing but very bright studio panel light for testing purposes. My lab partner and I were duly impressed by the sharp details and brightly saturated pictures of coral reef inhabitants floating across the big screen.As a 4K HDR projector, the clarity and detail are exceptional. Watching underwater photos felt like looking through the glass of a 131-inch-wide aquarium. The colors are rich and vibrant, thanks to its tri-color laser light source, which covers an impressive 107% of the BT.2020 color gamut. This translates to incredibly lifelike and nuanced colors, plus a real sense of depth that you don't get with most projections of this magnitude.How does the projector sound?The Pro 2's integrated sound system is another point worth mentioning. Valerion has packed in a 40-watt Harman Kardon system that, frankly, surprised me with its clarity and punch. For casual viewing, it's more than adequate. For movies, it provides a compelling soundstage -- so much so that, at first, it seemed like clear dialogue at high volume was emitting from the screen instead of the projector.Also:Finally, a portable 4K projector worthy of replacing my TV - and it supports Dolby VisionNaturally, audiophiles will still want their dedicated surround sound setups. But the built-in audio is a significant plus for a clean, minimalist installation.Gaming on the VisionMax Pro 2 was also on my to-do list because Valerion has included a dedicated game mode, which helps to keep any input lag to a respectable minimum. While I wouldn't pit it against a high-refresh-rate gaming monitor for competitive esports, I found it perfectly responsive for immersive single-player adventures and roving multiplayer fun. The sheer scale of the Pro 2's vivid pageantry makes gaming incredibly engaging.ZDNET's buying adviceLaunching at $3,000, theValerion VisionMaster Pro 2is a stunning piece of technology that delivers a luxurious viewing experience.It's ideal if you're looking for a massive, high-quality picture with vibrant colors and strong brightness, even in moderately lit rooms. It's also a good option for users who prefer a clean setup and have the budget for a high-end home cinema experience, potentially including an ALR screen. If your wallet can stretch and you're serious about your home cinema, this beautiful laser TV absolutely deserves a spot on your shortlist.The Pro 2 might not be suitable for those with a limited budget, as laser TVs are a significant investment. Despite being more space-efficient than many projectors, the Pro 2's potential will be severely limited if you have a small living and viewing space. Likewise, you won't be getting the most out of it if you usually watch content in a room with limited light control. Despite its impressive brightness, it is still projection technology.Also:The best outdoor projectors: Expert testedBy the bye, the Pro 2 is just one step down from Valerion'sVisionMaster \"Max\"(priced at $5,000), which isn't yet available for testing.Why the Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2 gets an Editors' Choice awardCompared with all the projectors I've reviewed, the Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2 is plenty portable and more durable than it looks. Incidentally, it looks beautiful whether it's sitting idly or doing its job. Above all, our lab tests found the Pro 2 to deliver above-standard visuals. While I was testing it on a 150-inch screen, my lab tech colleagues would walk into our Projector Cave and compliment the visual fidelity. Its price point is appropriate for the degree of quality and ease of use that was built into the projector.Show moreLooking for the next best product?

A reliable flashlight is a must-have, but not all are created equal. We tested the brightest flashlights of 2025 to find the ones that offer serious illumination and long-lasting battery life.Also:The best portable power stationsAn outdoor enthusiast myself, I rounded up some of the highest-quality flashlights I've come across, keeping in mind real-life factors that can decrease a light's output, which raw lumen outputs don't usually represent. A lumen is a unit of measurement for the intensity of the light coming out of a flashlight. The higher the lumens, the brighter the flashlight. I also spoke to survivalists, campers, and flashlight enthusiasts who have used and recommended some of their favorite models.What is the brightest flashlight right now?The world's brightest flashlight, theImalent MS32, clocks in at 200,000 lumens and has a built-in fan to keep the unit from overheating and hurting your hands. While this is the most powerful option, it does have a steep price tag. It's also not the only option for outdoor pursuits, severe weather supply arsenal, or even photography lighting, according to experts. Read on to see all of the brightest flashlight options for you.Sort byAllThe brightest flashlights of 2025Show lessView now at AmazonThe brightest flashlight you can currently buy is the Imalent MS32. Its maximum output supplies up to a blinding 200,000 lumens -- beating its previous title-winning 120,000 lumen iteration, the Imalent SR32. This model has eight settings, including cold and warm light options as well as a moonlight and strobe mode. When switched on, the Imalent MS32 emits the highest brightness level for about 45 seconds before dimming to 40,000 lumens, which it can sustain for about 40 minutes.As the world's brightest flashlight, the Imalent MS32 also has a heat pipe cooling system that uses three cooling fans to ensure high performance and to prevent overheating. In addition, the IP56 rating means the flashlight is water and dust-resistant.While not ideal for everyday carrying, this flashlight would serve well for emergency use cases (or if you want the bragging rights of owning the world's brightest flashlight). However, at $800, it's clear that the cost of the world's brightest flashlight requires a deluxe budget.Imalent MS32 tech specs: Lumens:200,000 lumens |Beam distance:5,308 feet |Peak beam intensity:655000cd |Battery Life:18 hours on lowest setting |IP Rating:IP56ProsWorld's brightest flashlightLong distance reachImpressive battery lifeEight different settingsConsNot ideal for everyday useHeavy at almost 12 poundsImalent MS32Brightest flashlight overallThe brightest flashlight you can currently buy is the Imalent MS32.

However, at $800, it's clear that the cost of the world's brightest flashlight requires a deluxe budget.Imalent MS32 tech specs: Lumens:200,000 lumens |Beam distance:5,308 feet |Peak beam intensity:655000cd |Battery Life:18 hours on lowest setting |IP Rating:IP56Read MoreShow Expert TakeShow lessShow lessView now at AmazonImalent's other option may not beam as bright as the world's brightest flashlight, but it's still a shining star packing in 55,000 lumens with 16 light-emitting diodes (also known as LEDs).

Remember to be mindful that the lumens claimed by manufacturers are not always 100% certain.Beam distance:Light won't matter if it can't go far. Consider each flashlight's beam distance to ensure the top picks had long throws.Durability:The brightest flashlights should be built with ruggedness and durability in mind, since their use-cases are mostly for the outdoors.Price:While the brightest flashlight in the world is expensive at $800, there are more affordable options for different price points.Show moreHow did we choose the best and brightest flashlights?ZDNET ranked the brightest flashlights by researching each flashlight extensively and spending time reading real customer reviews -- good and bad -- of each product. We also spoke to experts such as flashlight enthusiasts, survivalists, and explorers who have personally used these flashlights and recommend them.Show moreFAQs on flashlightsWhat are lumens?A lumen is a unit of measurement for the intensity of the light coming out of a flashlight. A high lumen output means that the flashlight shines bright.These brightest flashlights emit the most lumens of all flashlights on the market, when on the brightest setting, although many have multiple brightness options.Keep in mind that many flashlight manufacturers exaggerate their claimed lumens, and the lumen output may vary depending on your use case with the flashlight.Show moreHow many lumens does a good flashlight emit?The average flashlight emits about 100 lumens. However, any \"good\" flashlight worth buying will be greater than 1,000 lumens. It really depends on how you will be using your flashlight, and you probably don't need the world's brightest flashlight to look under the seats of your car.Show moreIs brightest always best?Bright flashlights that have a high lumen output are good for some scenarios, but they are most certainly not always the best. Short said super bright flashlights can actually make it harder to see.\"Brightest isn't always best for a lot of people. When flashlights are really bright, you get a lot of the beam shining off of things and back towards you, sometimes making it hard to see,\" he said.Poulson agrees and said that a higher lumen count will drain your flashlight's battery quicker.\"12,000 lumens do me little good if I can only use it for an hour or so. If I can get all-day use out of a 1,000-light, then that's what I want,\" he said. \"Also, a rechargeable battery is far more valuable to me than one that takes non-rechargeable ones. The way I use them, it would cost too much to have to replace batteries.\"However, use cases for a bright flashlight still exist, and you may find yourself needing the brightest in a situation.\"[Bright flashlights] could be used by a search and rescue scenario where you need to illuminate a wide broad surface area,\" Short added. \"You could also use a high lumen output light for self-defense to temporarily blind an attacker so you can remove yourself from a potentially horrible and scary situation.\"Show moreWhat is an EDC flashlight?EDC stands for everyday carry, and these flashlights are characteristically smaller than other models and can easily fit in your pocket. EDC lights are also known for being durable and have waterproof and shockproof features.Show moreAlternative bright flashlights to considerBest EDC alternativeNitecore EDC27This EDC flashlight from maker Nitecore has 3,000 lumens and is USB-C rechargeable.

Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production.CNET:Tariff Pricing Tracker: We're Watching 11 Products You Might Need to BuyLaptops and PCs are also hit hard by the new U.S. tariffs, with import duties potentially increasing prices by up to 35%. Many major brands still rely on Chinese and Vietnamese factories for assembly, meaning consumers could soon pay significantly more for everything from budget Chromebooks to high-end gaming rigs.These tariffs may accelerate efforts to move production to regions like Mexico or India, but shoppers can expect higher costs and fewer discounts in the short term.Right now, it looks like some tech may be exempt from the issued tariffs, but since it's always changing and developing, we are keeping an eye on it and will update you on the latest.Also:Tariff exemptions for electronics offer a break for tech - but not for longWhat is the best Chromebook for students?ChromebookStarting PriceStorageDisplayCameraBattery lifeAcer Chromebook Plus 516 GE$600256GB16-inch1080p10 hoursLenovo Flex 3i$35864GB12.2-inch touchscreen720p12 hoursLenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus$380256GB14-inch touchscreen1080p10 hoursHP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook$1,379256GB13.5-inch touchscreen5MP6 - 8 hoursAcer Chromebook 311$12964GB11.6-inch720p8 hoursShow moreWhich Chromebook is right for you?Choose this Chromebook...If you want..Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GEA Chromebook that's ideal for classwork and resource-intensive applications, making it my top pick overall.

Available for only $129, this option will ensure that students can study online without a problem, although it won't be suitable for more than basic tasks.Show moreHow did we choose these Chromebooks?ZDNET thoroughly researches and stays up to date with the Chromebook marketplace. We narrow down our searches for the best Chromebooks for students by examining customer feedback, technical specifications, and price changes.Along with selecting based on hands-on, expert testing, ZDNET also selected these Chromebooks for students based on CrXRPT 2.0 benchmarks. This test tells you how fast a Chromebook handles things you do every day, including playing video games, watching movies, and editing photos and provides an overall score. The higher the score, the better.This benchmark consists of six scenario tests: photo effects, face detection, offline notes, stock portfolio dashboard, DNA sequence analysis, 3D shapes with WebGL and three additional video, music, and game player tests.Photo Effects:Applies three effects -- Sharpen, Emboss, and Glow -- to two photos each, a set of six photos total.Face Detection:Checks for human faces in a set of five photos in low resolution.Offline Notes:Measures the time to encrypt, store, and display notes from local storage.Stock Portfolio Dashboard:Calculates and displays different graphical views of a stock portfolio.DNA Sequence Analysis:Measures the time it takes to process eight DNA sequences for open reading frames and amino acids.3D Shapes with WebGL:Generates equation-based 3D shapes and displays them with WebGL.Video Player:Plays a two-minute 1080p H.264 video clip in a browser from the local system.Music Player:Plays an audio clip for three minutes.HTML5-based game:Runs an impact.js-based game for about two minutes.All tests were run using ChromeOS 89. Wi-Fi was on, but Bluetooth was disabled during the benchmarking. The screens were set to 80% brightness.Show moreHow we test laptopsWe use a combination of methods to test laptops here at ZDNET. First, we acquire data from benchmarking software to analyze a system's metrics under the hood and compare those to advertised numbers. Then, we spend about a week or two with the laptop using it the same way a normal consumer would. This lets us analyze its portability, form factor, and how well the batteryactuallyholds up, among others. For an extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensivelaptop testing methodology.Benchmarking:First, we run a series of tests to put the computer's hardware through the wringer in order to see what it's capable of.Cinebenchis one of the most commonly-used hardware testing suites, which tests the laptop's rendering performance on single and multiple CPU cores.PCMark 10is another powerful program that covers a wide variety of tasks performed in the workplace, and there are many others that we use in tandem to gather as much data as we can. Some components we run tests on include:Processor:The \"brain\" of the laptop, and one of the most important factors that determines performance. The four biggest manufacturers that make most of the CPUs found in laptops today are Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple -- in their own machines only. This is tested in benchmarking software.The display:The size of the display is measured diagonally from corner to corner. This is also what dictates the laptop's overall size and play a big role in the laptop's cost. Brightness is measured in \"nits\", and color spectrums are tested in benchmarking software.The graphics processor (GPU):Whether it's integrated into the CPU or a dedicated graphics card, how well the machine handles graphics is a key factor when it comes to demanding visual tasks like video editing, rendering, and of course, gaming. We test the GPU with a combination of benchmarking software, gaming, and media playback.Physical form factor:Finally, the laptop's overall appearance and physical form factor encompasses its weight, thickness, how the keyboard and trackpad feel, and whether or not it has a display that can be folded back to form a tablet. We carry the laptop around for at least a week and note how well it commutes.Battery testing:We test a unit's battery in a few ways. A handful of benchmarking programs have their own battery testing components, but we also will just let the laptop run for as long as it can under a medium load. We ensure screensavers and hibernation mode are turned off, set the display's brightness and audio at 50%, load up a livestream on YouTube in Chrome, and wait 'til the end.The human element:As we mentioned earlier, metrics and system data is important, but numbers alone don't give you the full picture. This is where we weave in our personal experience with the device and tap into the practical use cases that consumers actually care about.Ultimately, our goal is to break down the capabilities of each and every laptop we test into digestible terms that real people can find useful. There is a lot of noise and confusion when it comes to navigating the laptop and computer consumer market, so we hope to bring an intuitive element to the whole process by leveraging our team's decades of experience.Show moreBest Chromebooks for students FAQsWhy use a Chromebook?Chromebooks are good for almost any job, but they'regreatfor students. If a student can use a web browser, they can use a Chromebook. They are easy to navigate and do not have the complexity or the same learning curves as a Windows, Mac, or Linux-based machine may have.For teachers and school administrators, Google also providesG Suite for EducationandGoogle Classroomto help them make remote learning as easy as possible.Show moreHow secure are Chromebooks?You can argue that thanks to ChromeOS' built-in security, even out-of-support Chromebooks are safer than a newer macOS or Windows laptop. In Chromebook's 10-year history,only around 50 ChromeOS security exploitshave been documented.The main point is that if you're short on cash, a cheap used or older model Chromebook will work just fine. Since it'strivial to erase a Chromebook and then reset it to your account, it's much safer than buying a used Windows laptop.Show moreAre Chromebooks good for students?A Chromebook can be a great laptop choice for students of all ages. They're more basic than their Windows counterparts, which means even very young children will be able to use them. They also have less powerful processors and graphics capabilities, reducing the temptation to play games all night rather than finish up homework.A Chromebook's battery life is its biggest selling point, with many models sporting at least 10 hours of use on a full charge. This means your kids won't have to keep track of charging cables in order to use their Chromebook throughout the school day.Show moreWhat are the disadvantages of a Chromebook?Chromebooks are excellent for casual, daily use and tasks such as using email, surfing the web, and completing homework assignments. However, they tend to lack the processing power and storage of many Windows and Mac laptops, and they are not suitable for tasks that require a lot of computing power.If you need a PC capable of handling creative applications, video editing, or gaming, a Chromebook probably isn't the right choice.Show moreCan a college student get by with a Chromebook?It is possible, and there may even be a few advantages. Chromebooks often have great battery life, so they're perfect for taking notes in lectures or completing assignments.However, if a college course requires the installation of specific software apps typically available on Windows or Mac, it might not be compatible with ChromeOS. In addition, the machine might not have the power to handle them anyway.Show moreAre there alternative Chromebooks for students worth considering?There are lots of options out there if you're looking for a Chromebook geared towards students of all ages.

It's the base model, though --the iPhone 16-- that was the best-selling smartphone model of the first four months of this year. What's interesting is that this is the first time in two years that the base variant of an iPhone series was in the top spot.CounterpointTheiPhone 16 Pro Max and 16 Profilled out spots two and three, and theiPhone 15took spot number four. It's not until fifth place that a non-Apple device makes an appearance with theGalaxy A16, followed by theGalaxy A06, and theGalaxy S25 Ultra. Notable here is that last year's Samsung flagship, the S24 Ultra, was the fifth best-selling phone at this point in 2024, marking a fall of two spots.TheRedmi 14Cfrom Xiaomi, a popular phone in the Middle East and Latin America, takes up spot number eight. It's the only model outside of Samsung and Apple to make the top 10.TheGalaxy A55and iPhone 16 Plus rounded out the top 10.There are a few things we can take from this study.First, a non-Pro model of the iPhone is what most people want. The largest and premium model in the iPhone 16 lineup was the second most popular, followed by the next model down. For the first quarter of 2024, theiPhone 15 Pro Maxwas the best-selling device.Additionally, with President Trump's impendingtariffsimpacting electronics prices around the globe, manufacturers likeAppleandSamsungare pushing more refurbished models. With several older models appearing on this list, it appears that the push might be working.Also:Why I prefer this rugged Samsung phone over flagship models (and it looks just as good)Both of those factors are likely a result of current economic conditions and an overall reticence to spend.Another interesting aspect of this study is that thelow-end smartphone segment(under $100) was the fastest growing category in the first quarter of 2025, accounting for 20% of global smartphone sales.Get the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with ourTech Today newsletter.SmartphonesThe best phones for 2024: Expert testedI'm a diehard Pixel user, but I'm considering a change for two reasons (and I'm not alone)I love this iPhone case's physical keyboard, but that isn't even its best featureThe best VPNs for iPhone and iPad: Expert testedThe best phones for 2024: Expert testedI'm a diehard Pixel user, but I'm considering a change for two reasons (and I'm not alone)I love this iPhone case's physical keyboard, but that isn't even its best featureThe best VPNs for iPhone and iPad: Expert testedEditorial standardsShow CommentsLog In to CommentCommunity GuidelinesRelatedThe Galaxy S25 Ultra redefines premium smartphones, and now it's $250 off for Memorial DayThis Android phone reminds me of an iPhone from the back, but it's a fraction of the priceI've tested every Samsung phone released in 2025: Here are my top picks including foldables",

Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production.Also:Tariff war has tech buyers wondering what's next. Here's what we knowTelevisions, many of which are manufactured in these nations, may experience price increases of up to 20%, making them less affordable for consumers. Manufacturers contemplate relocating assembly operations to countries with tariff exemptions, but such moves involve logistical challenges and substantial costs. Companies like Samsung, which produces a significant portion of their TVs in Mexico, anticipate being less affected than competitors relying heavily on Chinese manufacturing.Overall, consumers should brace for higher prices and potential shifts in product availability within the home entertainment market.Right now, it looks like some tech may be exempt from the issued tariffs, but since it's always changing and developing, we are keeping an eye on it and will update you on the latest.Also:Tariff exemptions for electronics offer a break for tech - but not for longWhat is the best Hisense TV?I chose the Hisense U9N as the best the brand can offer.

If you still watch broadcast television, look for a Hisense TV with upscaling capabilities in order to take full advantage of your 4K screen. And console gamers should look for a Hisense TV that supports VRR technology like Nvidia G-Sync or AMD FreeSync as well as higher refresh rates for smoother gameplay.Buy this best Hisense TV...If you need...Hisense U9NA well-rounded TV for upgrading your home theater.

With a dedicated art mode, you can create a personal gallery of your own photos or famous works.Show moreHow did I choose these Hisense TVs?While researching and testing each Hisense TV featured on this list, other ZDNET experts and I kept these criteria in mind:Price:No two budgets are created equal, but working with a limited budget shouldn't mean sacrificing features or accessibility. Conversely, just because you are able to spend more shouldn't mean you need to settle for a TV that's bloated with features you'll never use. Each TV on this list has been vetted to ensure that it offers the best value for the price based on comparable competitor models.Screen sizes:Every living room, home theater, apartment, and dorm is different. If you're looking to upgrade or buy your first smart TV, it's important to make sure that it will actually fit in your space without feeling too imposing or too small. Each Hisense TV featured is available in multiple screen sizes to accommodate different spaces.Picture and audio quality:Hisense TVs have come a long way since they first hit the market way back in 1978. Modern Hisense models offer support for multiple HDR and audio processing codecs like Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and DTS Digital for enhanced picture and sound quality.Connectivity:A new TV isn't worth much if you can't watch anything on it. New Hisense TV models offer Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity as-standard so you can start streaming shows, movies, and music right out of the box. They also offer plenty of HDMI and USB inputs for setting up home audio equipment, playback devices, and game consoles.Show moreAre Hisense TVs worth it?If you're looking to stick to a somewhat modest budget while shopping for a new TV but don't want to have to choose between cost and features, a Hisense model is definitely worth looking into. While the brand might not be as well-known as LG, Sony, Samsung, or even TCL, they still offer a wide range of TVs like the A6 for money-conscious shoppers as well as premium models like the U8K that feature upgraded QLED panels, support for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, as well as up to 144Hz refresh rates at 4K.Show moreWhich is better: Hisense or TCL?Hisense and TCL are both known for their budget and mid-range TVs, though both companies are also starting to add higher quality models to their lineups to compete with offerings from Samsung, LG, and Sony.Both Hisense and TCL offer similar features at comparable price points -- like both Roku and Google TV-based models, support for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, and QLED panels for enhanced picture quality. Whichever one feels like the better brand and model comes down to personal preference, budget, and minor feature differences.Show moreDoes Hisense make an OLED TV?Yes, but there's a catch: It's not available in the United States. TheHisense A9H OLEDwas released in 2022 featuring a self-lit OLED panel as well as a Sonic Screen similar to Sony's Acoustic Surface Audio+ tech. The A9H is available in the U.K. for around £1,700 for the 65-inch model. Hisense may be testing the international market for OLED televisions in order to compete with Samsung, LG, and Sony before making the A9H available in the U.S., but only time will tell.Show moreMore Hisense TVs to considerBest laser TVHisense L9QPre-orders are open for the latest version of Hisense's ultra short-throw laser projector, with an adjustable viewing size from 80 to 200 inches, 4K resolution, Dolby Vision HDR, and an IMAX Enhanced picture mode for movie buffs.View at HisenseBest big-screen Hisense TVHisense U76This 100-inch QLED TV from Hisense offers a true cinema-quality experience at home with a 144Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR, and Dolby Atmos virtual surround sound.View at AmazonZDNET’s TV GuideTVs RoundupsBest TV overallBest 85-inch TVBest 50-inch TVBest Samsung TVBest Sony TVBest Roku TVBest 40-inch TVBest 75-inch TVBest 32-inch TVBest TV for PS5Best OLED TVBest Hisense TVTV Models Reviewed and ComparedSony A80L OLED TV reviewApple TV 4K ReviewSamsung QN800B OLED 8K TV ReviewSamsung 65-inch QN90B QLED TV ReviewHisense 65-inch U8H 4K TV ReviewLG vs Samsung TVSamsung Frame TV 2024 vs 2023LG G4 vs Samsung S95DLG G4 vs G3LG G3 vs Samsung S95CTVs ExplainedCrystal UHD vs QLEDNEO QLED vs OLEDOLED vs LEDOLED vs QLEDMini LED vs OLED TVHow to screen mirror an iPhone to a Samsung TVHow to clear the cache on your TVShould you buy an 8K TV?How to clean a flat screen TV or monitorHow to calibrate your TV for the best pictureZDNETRecommendsThe best smartwatches you can buy: Apple, Samsung, Google, and more comparedThe 5 best VPN services (and tips to choose the right one for you)The best Android phones you can buy (including a surprise pick)The best robot vacuum and mop combos (and if they're worth the money)The best smartwatches you can buy: Apple, Samsung, Google, and more comparedThe 5 best VPN services (and tips to choose the right one for you)The best Android phones you can buy (including a surprise pick)The best robot vacuum and mop combos (and if they're worth the money)Editorial standardsShow CommentsLog In to CommentCommunity Guidelines",

Here's what it needs to show us.Written bySabrina Ortiz,Senior EditorMay 28, 2025 at 12:58 p.m. PTSabrina Ortiz/ZDNETApple finally entered the AI race at last year's Worldwide Developer Conference when it revealedApple Intelligence. However, some of thebiggest updatesannounced at WWDC 2024 -- such as a new and improved Siri and an AI that's aware of your personal context from your daily phone use --have yet to deploy, leaving users frustrated. Still, I think there is hope.Apple has done a lot well with the limited features ithasshipped -- and offered a promising glimpse of what's to come. For example, many of the new features -- including Genmoji, voice memo transcriptions, and photo clean-up -- are useful and easy to access, while also not being forcefully pushed to iOS users.Also:Forget Siri: Apple Intelligence's true potential on iPad and Mac lies in third-party appsMost importantly,Apple's A18 chipprovides the iPhone 16 models with the infrastructure and compute necessary for Apple to support more compute-heavy AI features, while keeping Apple's promise of on-device processing that can preserve your information's privacy and security. Although the full Apple Intelligence suite of tools has yet to be revealed, the foundation is there.Here are three features that would make me a believer in Apple Intelligence.1. A more Siri-ous voice assistantWhile Siri has a new look, with the screen glow showing up every time it's activated and a new way to interact with the AI via text, it's still trailing behind mostAI voice assistants.The biggest perk of conversational chat with a voice assistant is having it provide you -- almost instantly -- with feedback on anything you may be thinking of, from simple tasks such as the weather and notifications to more complex ones such as advice and math problems. Siri doesn't yet have the knowledge or intelligence to support this breadth of assistance.The actions it can perform for you are still pretty limited, and the more advanced conversational prompts require a reliance on ChatGPT. Because ChatGPT is a third-party application, there's a time lag when sending the message to the chatbot and then Siri answering. There's room for Apple to remove some reliance on ChatGPT and give its own assistant some TLC so that it can do more both in terms of knowledge and actions, which leads me to the next point.2. Go all in on agentic AISabrina Ortiz/ZDNETAgentic AI, which takes AI assistance one step further by taking actions on your behalf to carry out a task with minimal intervention, has been the biggest AI trend since last year's WWDC. Interestingly enough, at WWDC 2024, beforeAI agentswere all the buzz, Apple said that Apple Intelligence would be able to carry out tasks on your behalf, such as \"Pull the files that my coworker shared with me last week.\"While last year it was a really cutting-edge feature, to keep up, this year, it is especially necessary to roll these features out as quickly as possible to keep up and provide that extra something users are looking for.Also:What are AI agents? How to access a team of personalized assistantsMicrosoft,Google, andAnthropicall held their annual developer conferences last week, and all of them unveiled agentic AI products. Apple Intelligence was originally poised as a \"personal assistant,\" and I think adding this agentic functionality can bring it a step closer to that reality.3. Timing, timing, timingThe concept of Apple Intelligence being grounded in your personal information and context, retrieving data from across your apps, and referencing the content on your screen was a unique and helpful approach to implementing AI into an ecosystem of phones. While it would be amazing if Apple could ship this feature promptly, it is a relatively complex undertaking. I foresee further delays.In the meantime, Apple could announce another unique feature that is less of an undertaking, such as the rumoredrevamped Health appthat features an AI agent meant to replicate the insights a doctor can give patients based on their biometric data. Key to the success of any new feature Apple announces is that it needs to be ready to ship to restore user confidence lost due to the extended waiting period.Also:Apple's AI doctor will be ready to see you next springA combination of the features above would also help give users who only purchase a new phone with the A18 chip for Apple Intelligence a return on their investment beyond the phone's basic functionalities.Want more stories about AI?Sign up for Innovation, our weekly newsletter.Artificial IntelligenceThe best AI image generators are getting scary good at things they used to be terrible atThe best AI for coding in 2025 (including two new top picks - and what not to use)I tested 10 AI content detectors - and these 5 correctly identified AI text every timeMeet the most important AI tool that no one is talking about - but everyone needsThe death of spreadsheets: 6 reasons why AI will soon be the dominant business reporting toolUse AI at work?

Here's a look at what's new and how you can join.Also:The best Samsung phones to buy in 2025Which phones are eligible for the One UI 8 beta?For now, the rollout is only for three devices in theS25 series– the S25, the S25 Plus, and theS25 Ultra. Sorry,S25 Edgeowners.Samsungdidn't offer an explanation for why it left out the S25 Edge, but it could be because the phone is alreadyfacing criticismfor its reduced battery life.This follows the same pattern as last year'sOne UI 7 beta,which debuted for select S24 devices. One UI 8 will be available on Samsung's newest foldable devices this summer and will gradually expand to other Galaxy devices later this year. One UI 7 was exclusive to the S24 for about three months, which was frustrating for fans with other devices, but thatmight notbe the case this time around.What's new in Samsung One UI 8?It's no surprise that AI leads the way in terms of what's new. Samsung says that the One UI 8 beta isn't necessarily introducing any new features, but will enhance existing AI features that were first introduced in the Galaxy S25. You'll notice changes in three ways: multimodal capabilities, a user experience tailored to different devices, and personalized, proactive suggestions.Samsung explains that the new multimodality will understand what you're looking at or watching and be able to have natural, seamless communication about it, even understanding context about your daily routine. The \"tailored to different devices\" part essentially means that Samsung is making sure that tablets and foldable phones get a unique look that suits their design (much like Google did with Android 16).Also:I changed 7 Samsung phone settings to give it an instant battery boostAlso new:Refreshed Quick Share:The Quick Share feature, which lets you send and receive files between compatible Galaxy devices, is getting a redesign that lets you share with a single tap.Redesigned Reminder app:Your Reminder app is getting a little more intuitive, especially for travel. You can now add categories to reminders and see all your categories at a glance, share to-do lists with other users, and add reminders with your voice.Easier Auracast:Auracast, which lets you broadcast audio to multiple devices (like Galaxy Buds3 and hearing aids) at the same time, is getting a little easier to use. You can now connect to a shared audio stream by simply scanning a QR code instead of going through a manual process.How to sign up for the Samsung One UI 8 betaIf you have a Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, or S25 Ultra device, signing up for the One UI 8 beta is easy.

Some support higher wattage levels to charge laptops and other higher-capacity consumer electronics such as power stations and portable batteries. Some even possess USB-IF or Thunderbolt certifications, meaning they have been tested to more rigorous performance, safety, and build quality standards.Most USB-C cables sold support USB 2.0 data rates (480mbps), whereas others support higher data rates supported by the iPhone 15 Pro.Many cables on the market, such as Apple's OEM USB-C charge cable, also only have 1-year warranties, effectively making them throwaway products, whereas others have 18-month, 2-year, 5-year, or even lifetime warranties. For this list, we've chosen a variety of well-known vendors with reputable support policies.If you have theiPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Plusor only need a charging cable with your iPhone 15 Pro, any Charging/USB 2.0 cables on this list are fine.If you plan to charge theiPhone, iPad Pro, and laptop, you'll want cables with a 100W charge capacity or higher.If you have aniPhone 15 Pro or an iPhone 15 Pro Maxand want to transfer data at high speed (10Gbps), you will want a Thunderbolt/USB 4 cable or USB 3.1 Gen 2/USB 3.2 Gen 2 cable.Show moreWhat's the difference between USB 2.0, USB 3.1 Gen 2, USB 3.2 Gen 2, USB 4, Thunderbolt, and USB PD?TheUSB 2.0data connectivity standard was introduced in April of 2000, with a data transfer rate of 480Mbps. Lightning, the connector standard used from the iPhone 5 to the iPhone 14, and the USB-C connector on the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, use USB 2.0 signaling protocols and data transfer rates.TheUSB 3.1data connectivity standard was introduced in July 2013, and the USB Type-C connector was finalized by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) in August 2014.USB 3.2was introduced in September 2017, replacing, absorbing, and renaming the USB 3.1 specification.However,USB 3.1 Gen 2 and USB 3.2 Gen 2data connectivity standards are the same, also known as SuperSpeed+, delivering 10 Gbps. Products labeled undereither specificationshould work on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone Pro Max at native speeds, especially if they are USB-IF certified.Thunderboltis a proprietary technology owned by Intel and co-developed with Apple. It is a hardware interface for connecting external peripherals to a computer (a PC or a Mac).Thunderbolt version 3is the basis for theUSB4specification, supports up to 40Gbps throughput, and is backward compatible withUSB 3.2 Gen 2, which the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max are compatible with.USB Power Delivery(USB PD) is a fast charging standard delivered over USB-C cables, supporting up to 100W with Standard Power (SPR) and up to 240W with Extended Power (EPR) provided the cable and device support it. With USB PD, The cable \"listens\" to the device's wattage needs and adjusts its energy flow accordingly. So, if you connect an 18W iPhone 15 to a cable that can support up to 240W, the charger brick and cable with USB PD support will throttle down to 18W maximum charge rate.Show moreShould I buy a Thunderbolt-certified cable?In our discussions with Bernie Thompson, the founder ofPlugable, which sells USB-IF-certified and Thunderbolt cables, he recommended that you should buy aThunderbolt-certifiedcable if you are using it for fast data transfer on an iPhone 15 Pro, as that is the industry standard Apple has aligned itself with (and is a founding member along with Intel) for its products. It is overkill, but it is guaranteed to work.However, a less expensive USB 3.1 Gen 2/USB 3.2 Gen 2 cable should also work – but we haven't had the chance to test one on an iPhone 15 Pro yet. Per Apple'ssupport page:\"iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max support fast USB 3.2 Gen 2 speeds up to 10Gbit per second when using an optional USB 3 cable.\"Show moreAre there alternative USB-C cables worth considering?There are plenty of other USB-C cables aside from our top picks above.

It uses an upgraded, Mini-LED panel to produce more accurate colors, deeper contrast, and sharper details. A 120Hz refresh rate gives you smoother motion during fast-paced sports broadcasts, movies, shows, and games. The integrated speakers work with Dolby Atmos virtual surround sound and Samsung's object-tracking sound technology for audio that follows the on-screen action and a more immersive experience.

They're great earbuds for iOS users who want a small, pocketable pair of earbuds to take while traveling, commuting, and living everyday life.If you want the latest and greatest AirPods, you may want to wait for the AirPods Pro 3 since these earbuds are due for a refresh within the next year. However, the AirPods Pro 2 have plenty of useful features, and you can often find them as low as $189 during seasonal sales.Who should look elsewhere:Like all of Apple's headphones, the Pro 2 are not suitable for Android users. If you pair these earbuds with a non-Apple device, you'll miss out on key features like spatial audio, adaptive noise cancellation, conversation awareness, and ahearing aid feature, all of which are reserved for iOS. So, if you're an Android user and want premium earbuds, consider thePixel Buds Pro 2instead.AirPods Pro 2 tech specs: Form factor:In-ear |Bluetooth:Yes (5.3) |Battery life:6 hours and an additional 30 hours with charging case |IP rating:IP54 (sweatproof) |Driver size:11mm dynamic |Noise cancellation:Yes |Charging option(s):USB-C, wirelessRead MoreShow Expert TakeShow lessShow lessView now at AmazonView now at B&H Photo-VideoView now at CrutchfieldWhy we like them:Focal's Azurys are the company's entry-level headphones, offering consumers a more affordable price point to enjoy the high-end brand's acclaimed audio technology.

Some are better at noise cancellation, while others sound better or have more stylistic flair. The headphones your best friend loves and recommends you try might be the worst headphones you've ever worn, which is why it's essential to consider these factors before you buy:Battery life:Nothing is worse than throwing on your headphones and seeing they're on 5% battery. If you often forget to charge your headphones, you'll want a pair with an extensive battery life. So, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra might not be your best option, but the JBL Live 770NC could work better for you.Use cases:There are many types of headphones, so you must ensure you're buying the right kind that matches your specific use cases. Perhaps your friend recommended the Sonos Ace headphones for their great sound, but you expected stronger noise-canceling -- a feature you anticipated, especially for the amount of money you spent. If you want headphones for commuting, make sure the headphones you're eyeing are suitable for that. If you prefer to wear headphones in more active scenarios, consider earbuds instead of over-ear headphones.Lifestyle headphones vs. audio-focused headphones:Headphones fall into two categories. Lifestyle (consumer) headphones are the headphones you see from brands like Bose, Apple, and Sony. However, brands like Sony and Sennheiser manufacture both lifestyle and audio-focused headphones. Lifestyle headphones can accompany you on your daily commute, to the office, and to the gym -- all on the same day. On the other hand, audio-focused headphones, like the Focal Azurys, may lack the comfort, noise-canceling tech, and portability that lifestyle headphones possess since their primary use case is to examine audio critically.Operating system:Some headphones and earbuds are meant to work best with devices within that manufacturer's device ecosystem. Apple's AirPods Pro 2, Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 are examples. If you have mostly Apple devices, AirPods may be your best option. If you have a mixed-device ecosystem, consider headphones from Bose, Sony, or JBL.Show moreHow we test headphonesThe ZDNET team spends weeks with a pair of headphones to give you an informed opinion before you make a purchase. Here arethe benchmarks we use to test headphones.Comfort and design:We wear headphones for hours at a time to determine how long we can wear them before they become uncomfortable. We also test headphones across all budgets, meaning we test headphones made from inexpensive and more expensive materials to test durability.Noise cancellation:We wear noise-canceling headphones in various environments to test how well the technology performs in quieter and louder settings.Sound quality:Sound quality and sound profiles are highly subjective, as some people prefer heavier bass, while others prefer more pronounced treble. To give you the best idea about a pair of headphones' sound profile, we listen to them with different audio modes enabled. We also listen to headphones on various devices, like iPhones, Macs, Windows computers, tablets, and TVs, to listen for sound distinctions.Battery life:In rare cases, battery life deviates from a manufacturer's claim, and battery life varies depending on how you use a pair of headphones. To ensure a pair of headphones offers as much battery as advertised, we integrate the review unit into our daily lives by listening to music, taking calls, and enabling features like spatial audio.Use cases:No pair of headphones is a one-size-fits-all affair. Usually, headphones have a specific use case, whether for critical listening, watching TV, exercising, or canceling environmental noises. To determine which group of consumers will benefit the most from a pair of headphones, we test headphones in various use cases to specify their purpose.Show moreHow do I choose the right headphones?Before you buy a pair of headphones, you should consider a few things besides price. A pair of headphones' form factor, connectivity, and features are equally important. Here are some other things to consider before making a purchase.Earbuds or headphones?Earbuds are smaller, more portable, and often protected against sweat and exposure to rain, but they have a shorter battery life. Headphones are larger and sometimes less portable but typically offer more immersive audio and noise-canceling experiences.Wired or wireless (Bluetooth)?:I recommend wired headphones for people who want to occasionally listen to music critically. Over a wired connection, you can access high-resolution music playback. If that doesn't matter to you and you'd rather have portable and wire-free headphones, you want wireless headphones. Fortunately, many consumer headphones can be wired or wireless, and many wireless headphones in this list can achieve high-resolution audio playback via a wired connection.Show moreHeadphones FAQsAre the Sony XM6 better than the Sony XM5?The Sony XM5 and XM6 are both great headphones. Both provide listeners with expertly tuned sound, impressive noise cancellation, and an unassuming design fit for the everyday person. However, the XM6 excel in noise cancellation, and they sport a foldable design, making them more portable.Now that the XM6 have arrived, you can find the XM5 at lower prices, making them a better option for budget-focused buyers.Show moreSony or Bose: Which brand is best for you?Both Sony and Bose make some of the best consumer headphones on the market. Both companies champion years of innovation and research, but each company's headphones' strengths shine in different categories. Sony is better for producing reliable headphones with a nondescript design, while Bose's headphones are more comfortable and integrate with the company's other consumer audio products.You should choose Sony's XM6 headphones if you want reliable, everyday headphones with a premium and durable build, rich sound, effective noise cancellation, and a lengthy battery life. Sony's flagship headphones promise 40 hours of listening time, 16 more than the QC Ultra.You should choose the Bose QC Ultra headphones if you want more comfortable headphones with a more intense focus on design elements. Bose's premium headphones are often rereleased in seasonal colors and feature metal accents and stylish branding.Show moreShould I buy on-ear or over-ear headphones?I preferover-ear headphonesover on-ear headphones. On-ear headphones, like the Beats Solo 4, sit on your ears, while over-ear headphones, like the AirPods Max, cover your entire ear. Over-ear headphones create a better seal between your ears and the outside world, allowing for increased noise-canceling performance and a more immersive audio experience.However, you may like on-ear headphones if you want headphones with a more compact shape. If you don't like noise-canceling or prefer to hear your surroundings better, you should consider on-ear headphones.Show moreHow long do headphones last?A solid pair of headphones should last you five years, if not more. You can get great mileage on your headphones by taking care of them. To make the most of yours, here are some tips I use myself:Avoid exposing your over-ear headphones to excessive moisture or rain; do not submerge them in water. I don't recommend working out in over-ear headphones because sweat can degrade the ear pad materials. However, if you work out in your over-ear headphones, wipe the ear pads with a cloth after your workout to remove sweat. Or, you can purchase sweat covers for your ear pads. Earbuds and bone conduction headphones are better equipped for exposure to sweat and rain.Store your headphones in their case when not in use for long periods. Most headphones come with a protective hardshell carrying case or pouch. The case protects your headphones from dust, moisture, scratches, or scrapes.Never spray your headphones or earbuds with chemicals or solvents.Regularly check your headphones' companion app for software updates. Many headphones receive about five years of software updates, and keeping your headphones updated ensures optimal performance.Show moreAre there alternative headphones worth considering?While the options listed above should get you pretty far, you might still be interested in alternative options.

Hardware-demanding work, such as video editing, requires a high-end computer.For this reason, you need to know what you're looking for in a laptop. You don't want to buy a device that's going to struggle. Here's how to figure out which laptop for graphic design works best for you:Choose this laptop for graphic design...If you want…Apple MacBook Pro M4The best graphic design laptop overall.

The 2024 model boasts a new processor to better handle tough workloads and a high-resolution OLED touchscreen.Show moreFactors to consider when choosing a laptop for graphic designA laptop for creative users must provide more power than a laptop aimed at general usage. Here are some of the top factors you'll want to consider before making a purchase:Hardware:Creative professionals rely heavily on their laptops' graphics cards to do their work. Graphics cards must also be paired with strong CPUs and a good amount of RAM to perform at a high level.Display:All that performance doesn't mean squat if the laptop's display can't accurately showcase your work. Creative professionals greatly prefer high-resolution displays.Screen size:16-inch or 17-inch laptops are much heavier than 13-inch or 14-inch devices. Regular travelers may want something smaller so they can leave the laptop with the big screen at the office or at home.Battery life:Decide whether you need a high-end laptop that can accomplish tasks but only run for a few hours, or a mid-ranger that can last an entire day.Price:Price is an important factor to consider when shopping for laptops. Obviously, the more expensive options tend to have better hardware. That said, don't completely discount the cheaper models because many still deliver awesome performance.Show moreHow we test laptopsThere are many excellent laptops on the market for graphic design, and our staff at ZDNET has the opportunity to review many of them. We look at the aforementioned factors, including display, battery life, and value. We then test them as we would use them in the real world, from surfing the internet to streaming videos to more specific use cases for graphic design.Once all the testing is complete, the ones we liked are reviewed, given a specific category, like thebest Windows laptopfor graphic design, and placed on the list.For more on our testing process, check out our comprehensivelaptop testing methodologypage.Show moreFAQs on graphic design laptopsIs battery life important in the best laptops for graphic designers?Yes, but it depends on what you have.Battery life is essential for lightweight, travel, or cheap laptops. These models don't have the most superb hardware in the world and are often mid-range devices. As a result, they're not very power-hungry. You won't have to worry about your laptop dying on you in the middle of a project. Plus, they're not heavy.Battery life doesn't matter as much for bulky, powerful laptops like the MSI Creator Z16. You'll be using this machine primarily at home, and computers of this caliber are heavy. Speaking from experience, you don't want to lug around a big laptop daily. Plus, their hardware demands a lot of power, so your battery will drain much more quickly.Show moreIs connectivity important in the best laptops for graphic designers?Having a wide array of ports on a graphic design laptop is important, but ultimately, it comes down to what you need.Some manufacturers equip their devices with only a few inputs in order to keep sizes small and the weight low. This is a good design move for ultraportable laptops. That said, creative professionals work with a variety of devices and peripherals. Perhaps they need to connect their laptop to an external display or multiple monitors. This extends to audio equipment and SD cards, too.Good laptop connectivity options are crucial to many professionals' work. You can solve this problem by buying a docking station to complement your computer, obtaining way more inputs and outputs than you ever could.Also:The best 5 laptop docking stationsIf you just want a single device, you may be better off buying a heftier laptop with a variety of ports. A lightweight machine is ideal for travel.Show moreAre MacBooks really that much better than Windows laptops when it comes to graphic design?When it comes to hardware, not really. Modern MacBooks certainly have powerful M-series chipsets, allowing them to rise above the rest, but Windows laptops have come a long way in bridging the gap. We would argue that Windows hardware is comparable to, and in some cases better than, Apple's tech.The main difference between the two comes down to software. MacBooks have a great selection of apps onboard that still trounces Microsoft software. GarageBand is still great for editing music, and iMovie is also fantastic for basic video edits.Also:Boost your security and productivity with the top Mac appsWindows 11, on the other hand, doesn't have the greatest selection. For years, base apps on Windows computers were terrible. No one in their right mind takes Paint seriously. That's what PhotoShop is for. Things have improved, but base apps on Windows 11 still pale compared to what's on macOS. Those starting software choices can make a huge difference.Show moreCan gaming laptops be used for graphic design?Gaming laptops are definitely a great alternative for graphic designers. They are often equipped with some of the most powerful processors in the tech industry. They also have great graphics cards, huge storage drives, and a ton of RAM, providing professionals with all the power and space they need for work. Many even have stunning displays.Also:Best budget gaming laptops of 2025That said, they do have some problems. 1) Gaming laptops can be heavy. In some cases, over seven pounds. 2) They're expensive. 3) They don't always have the most pleasing designs. Several models feature bulky, all-black designs, or RGB lighting that not everyone likes.Show moreWhen is the best time to get laptop deals?Laptops constantly go on sale throughout the year, but many devices see deeper discounts on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In fact, those two days are usually the best time to find great deals for laptops, although Amazon Prime Day comes close. Many brands get in on the festivities. Apple slashes the price tag on MacBooks, Lenovo does the same with ThinkPads, and Asus discounts its ZenBook laptops. You'll be able to find these deals across multiple online retailers like Amazon, QVC, Best Buy, and Walmart. You will be hard-pressed to find a website that doesn't engage.The next big shopping day is Boxing Day, which is December 26. Prices usually aren't slashed as steeply on this day as they are on Black Friday, but you can still find great deals. It's hard to say what will be on sale this Boxing Day.Show moreOther graphic design laptopsBest travel laptop for graphic designLG Gram Pro 17If you're looking for a laptop with a huge display that is still portable, it doesn't get lighter than LG's Gram Pro 17.

After their resurgence with the first Galaxy Z Flip, the best flip phones have only gotten better over the years. The new Motorola Razr Ultra, for instance, packs an AMOLED foldable display, feature-rich user interface and a comfortable in-hand feel, alongside a bunch of AI features. It's truly the best flip phone of 2025. However, the $1,300 might not suit many consumers. If you're on a budget and still want a flip phone, fret not. There are plenty ofclamshell foldablephones under $1,000 that marry form and factor and are priced in an accessible (and reasonable) manner.Motorola Razr Ultra | Best flip phone overallMotorola Razr UltraBest flip phone overallView nowView at AmazonSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 | Best flip phone for software longevitySamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6Best flip phone for software longevityView nowView at AmazonMotorola Razr 2025 | Best mid-range flip phoneMotorola Razr 2025Best mid-range flip phoneView nowView at AmazonMotorola Razr (2023) | Best cheap flip phoneMotorola Razr (2023)Best cheap flip phoneView nowView at AmazonNokia 2780 Flip | Best dumb flip phoneNokia 2780 FlipBest dumb flip phoneView nowView at AmazonWhat is the best flip phone right now?Samsung and Motorola are the top two brands making flip phones right now. Of all the flip phones we'vetested and reviewedso far, theMotorola Razr Ultrais our pick for the best flip phone of 2025. It houses the latest AI features alongside a powerful flagship chipset but the biggest update comes in the form of a new titanium-reinforced hinge plate, which Motorola says is four times stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel and can withstand up to 35% more folds than last year's models.TheSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6is another good pick. It's a tight race between the two, but the Razr Ultra edges out with a more useful and larger outer display -- which is one of the main appeals of a modern-day flip phone -- as well asbetter battery lifeand faster charging.Also:The best Android phones in 2025Sort byAllBest flip phones in 2025Show lessView now at AmazonWhy we like it:Motorola's Razr Ultra is better than the Galaxy Z Flip 6 in multiple ways. I went hands-on with the new Razr Ultra model recently, and was thoroughly impressed by the improved hinge system, which makes the phone feel sturdier to flip open and close. Moreover, it features the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and 12GB of RAM for a slew of AI features and powerful performance.As for the outer display, it supports virtually any app you throw at it. You can browse the web, play games, scroll TikTok, and do other mobile tasks without ever needing to flip open the device. In comparison, Samsung's platform is more limited in this regard. The Motorola Razr Ultra also has a textured backing, including new Alcantara and Wood finishes, which I've found to be easier to hold and grip than competing flip phones.Review:Motorola Razr Ultra (2025)Who it's for:At $1,299, the Razr Ultra is not a cheap flip phone. It's ore expensive than the Samsung counterpart. That said, it packs a bigger and faster charging battery, larger screens, two 50MP cameras, and AI features that are actually useful. If you want the most complete, durable, and visually-stimulating flip phone on the market right now, you'll have to pay to play with the Razr Ultra. It is for those who want a fashion-forward flip phone without any compromises.Who should look elsewhere: The Razr Ultra includes top-notch specs, but if you want a phone that'd last at least five years, Motorola might not be your favorite brand. It offers a relatively short software update cadence, which ranges from 2 to 3 years, versus Google and Samsung's 7 years.

The Razr also has the same screen size as its Plus siblings.Nokia 2780 FlipA dumb phone that promotes digital wellbeing and detoxing, with bare-bones features and specs for phone calls, texting, and light internet browsing.Show moreFactors to consider when choosing a phoneThe process of making our phone selections includes real-world testing and researching about the phones for weeks, consulting with colleagues, industry experts, and analysts who also have hands-on experience with the smartphones, and then selecting the best from all of the available choices.Ultimately, we weigh in the following aspects when curating this list:Design:The best-designed flip phones are practical to use, require a low to moderate learning curve, and should have a burdenless hand feel.Software optimization:A flip phone relies on more than just the standard software features of a traditional handset; it needs specialized tools and services built for the outer displays.Durability:The best flip phone can withstand a beating, whether that's in the form of waist-high drops or pouring rain. It helps when a device is certified IPX8 or IP52 or has been tested to meet above-average durability standards.Value:It's difficult to ignore how expensive flip phones can be, so price-to-performance is something deeply considered when evaluating between devices. Carrier store promotions, trade-in deals, and other offers are also factored in.Show moreKerry Wan/ZDNETHow we test phonesZDNET's review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every major phone release, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and special features. Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:Design and ergonomics:How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.Performance:Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, with all background tasks closed, and with as stable of a mobile connection as possible.Camera quality:ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.Battery life and charging:It's also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it (wired, wireless, or both).Special features:These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.Pricing and availability:Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.For a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensivephone testing methodology page.Show moreFAQs on flip phonesWill Apple make a flip phone?It's the question everyone's been asking since the very first foldable was launched back in 2019: whether or not Apple will put out a foldable iPhone of its own. While the company has yet to unveil any plans of making one, and the rumor mill has been rather slow in that regard, it would not be surprising if there's a team within Cupertino already building one out.Also:Why foldable phones are still so expensive, according to analystsAnd, as is often the case with consumer technology, once Apple does feel comfortable enough to release a mass-market foldable phone, we can expect there to be a drop in overall pricing in the market, as manufacturers scramble to compete in value. The latest rumors point to a release as soon as in 2026.Show moreLatest updatesIn our May 2025 update, we added the Motorola Ultra Razr as our top pick, as well as replacing the Motorola Razr (2024) with the latest Razr from 2025.Other flip phones we've testedBest Samsung alternativeSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5The Galaxy Z Flip 5 from 2023 is still a formidable choice if you're eyeing a pocket-friendly handset.

Many smart rings claim to last a week's worth of battery, but only make it to five or six days before dying on me. Part of the appeal of smart rings, compared to smartwatches, is their longer battery life, so what gives?Also:5 essential gadgets for my bedtime routine (and why they make such a big difference)I've got one for you if you want a smart ring with a truly competitive battery life. I've been testing theRingConn Gen 2smart ring that boasts a marathon battery life of 10 to 12 days. The smart ring comes with other perks -- and a few drawbacks -- that I'll get to below.ZDNET RECOMMENDSRingConn Gen 2The RingConn Gen 2 offers the longest battery life I've tested. It lasted longer than my Oura Ring 4.detailsView at AmazonRight off the bat, the RingConn 2 has some green flags. Unlike competing smart ring brands with products that start at $350 and go all the way up to $400 or $450, this smart ring costs $300 -- and does not require a subscription to gain full access to your health data. Sizing starts at size six and goes through size 14, and you can get the ring in three colors: silver, black, and gold.The build of the ring is more square than circular, but I found myself unbothered by this unique shape. It fits comfortably around my finger with no problems. Despite healthy and frequent wear, the ring doesn't tarnish easily either.Also:Two popular smart ring makers just got caught copying Oura - here's what happens nextThe RingConn Gen 2 comes with a case that extends its already impressively long battery life, powering the smart ring's empty battery for over 150+ days. As someone who is constantly charging several wearable devices at a time, this long-lasting charging case that I could use without hooking the smart ring up to an outlet made me partial to RingConn.Most smart rings offer up daily scores for two to three important health metrics: sleep, activity, and readiness. Readiness is calculated based on yesterday's activity, how you slept, and other biometric data, like how late your heart rate dropped as you slept.Also:The best sleep trackers of 2025: Expert tested and reviewedThe RingConn Gen 2 measures your vitals, sleep, activity, and stress, but doesn't measure readiness. Instead of readiness, it provides a Wellness Balance feature. It takes all of the aforementioned data and displays it in a flower-like graph, with longer petals for the biometrics that are meeting or exceeding the recommended benchmarks and shorter petals for those that aren't.When all your petals are the same length, it indicates that your wellness is at equilibrium. I liked that I could see all the important data displayed in such a digestible and visual manner right as I opened the app.RingConn's Wellness Balance compiles your activity, sleep, vitals, and stress scores into a holistic illustration of your health.Screenshot by Nina Raemont/ZDNETHardcore trainers use the readiness or energy feature on their smart ring apps to gauge how intense their exercise regimen should be for the day. If that's you, you might be displeased with the Wellness Balance functionality, and I'd recommend the Oura Ring, Ultrahuman Ring, or Galaxy Ring instead.The app delivers your scores alongside context that helps inform the reasoning behind your sleep or vitals score. I was ill one day while testing the ring and spent the entire day sleeping. Because of the large amount of time I spent in bed, it told me that too much sleep can slow down my metabolism or lead to weight gain.Also:The best smart rings of 2025: I tested and found an obvious winnerRingConn says that the battery on its second-generation ring lasts up to 10 to 12 days, but in my testing, I found that it only lasted seven. Still, that's far longer than the battery lives of other smart rings I've tried, which last four to five days on a single charge. I can say without a doubt that this smart ring has the most impressive battery life out of every brand I've tried.Nina Raemont/ZDNETAccording to its website, the RingConn Gen 2 also boasts a sleep apnea detection feature with 90.7% accuracy. If you're a chronic snorer looking to learn more about how your breathing impacts you throughout the night, the sleep apnea feature could help monitor your conditions and answer some of your questions.It tells you when there are significant or minor outliers in your sleep throughout the night, providing not only a graph detailing this but also a timeline showing when your SpO2 fluctuated during the night.I wore the Oura Ring 4 in tandem with the RingConn Gen 2 and found that the latter seems to underestimate both the time spent asleep and the steps I've taken throughout the day.Also:Oura Ring users are customizing their wearables with this clever design hackThe RingConn and Oura both ranked my sleep efficiency in the 87th and 88th percentiles. Oura said I got 11 hours and eight minutes of sleep, while RingConn said I spent 10 hours and 50 minutes asleep. RingConn reported 11,091 steps, while Oura reported 15,259 steps. I've seen in various Reddit threads that the Oura Ring tends to overestimate step count, which could account for the great disparity in steps between rings.On a healthy night of sleep, Oura recorded eight hours and two minutes, a sleep efficiency of 94%, and a sleep score of 90. RingConn recorded an 84 sleep score, seven hours and 45 minutes asleep, and a sleep efficiency of 91%. In both cases, RingConn is subtracting around 15 minutes from my night's sleep.ZDNET's buying adviceI enjoyed most aspects of wearing thissubscription-free smart ring, and at $300 ($50 less than competitors), it's a smart ring I'd recommend to those looking for an alternative to Oura's subscription-based services. especially if you want a smart ring with a battery life that will actually last you a week before recharging.The one area where I noticed RingConn's smart ring lacking was in its user interface. The app feels underdeveloped, and some of the messages lacked personal context that proved they were being generated from my own data. On one good sleep score day, all that it said when I clicked on the sleep tab was: \"Good sleep makes you happy.\" That's my only true gripe, and I hope the recommendations can become more tailored and informative in future software updates.Otherwise, theRingConn Gen 2is an impressive smart ring with comprehensive health metric monitoring that's on the cheaper end of the smart ring spectrum. It accurately tracks sleep with features like sleep apnea monitoring that could help you uncover your snoring patterns, it's got a marathon battery life (plus a charging case with 150 days' worth of juice in it), and a build you can wear comfortably.What are the tariffs in the US?The recentUS tariffson imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics.

But withSamsung's QN90D Neo QLED TV, that's what happened -- in a big-time (ultra-large) way.That's because Samsung sent the 98-inch model to our ZDNET lab in Louisville, and I had the pleasure of spending some time with it, fully daunted by its imposing $15,000 price tag. This is the most expensive model of any TV I've tested.Also:I changed these 6 Samsung TV settings to instantly improve the picture qualitySo, does the QN90D live up to its price point? If your budget falls into the $10K+ cost echelon, then you've already jumped the first hurdle in acquiring one. And if that's the case, then the answer is a resounding \"Yes.\"ZDNET RECOMMENDSSamsung 98-inch QN90D 4K TVOne of the largest TVs from the Korean giant features 98 inches of LED, a full array of local dimming goodness, with deep blacks and vivid colors.detailsView at Best BuyTo be clear, there are dozens of 98-inch TVs on the market that are much easier on the wallet than this puppy. For example, you can buy two ofTCL's 98-inch QM8 Mini-LEDfor less than one QN90D. But there's a substantial difference in the technology behind these models, namely Samsung's treatment of Quantum Dot overlays on a mini-LED backlit display.Also:I still recommend this TCL TV model from last yearThis formula is known as \"Neo QLED,\" in which case Samsung has swapped out conventional LEDs for tens of thousands of mini-LEDs. These components consist of manufactured nanocrystals with ultra-fine semiconductor materials, allowing for a higher magnitude of these units to distribute light accurately and efficiently. The result, as Samsung puts it, is \"brighter whites, darker blacks, and overall, a better color range in between.\"I can attest to this. The QN90D offered up a crystal-clear picture with glistering highlights, vibrant colors, and the truest blacks I've witnessed on a non-OLED set. With its spread of UHD micro dimming zones, dark areas are so piercingly black that focusing your eyes on shadows is like staring into a void. This is fine by me because they're shadows, and I'm a fan of higher contrast ratios.Adam Breeden/ZDNETBut in some extreme cases, dark objects were so dark that their features were lost. Picture a black-clad motorcyclist racing down a sunlit road -- black helmet, black jacket, black bike -- and in this distant, wide-angle shot, the cyclist and his bike become almost a uniform silhouette, revealing no distinguishable textures or dimensionality. To be clear, this would be a demanding ask of any TV for the scene I'm describing. A desirable level of detail in such inky blackness may only be captured on Samsung'sNeo QLED 8K QN990C, which goes for an eye-watering $43,000 and is the subject of a different review altogether.Also:The best TVs you can buyWhat impressed me most was the in-your-face brightness and extraordinary color gamut of the QN90D. It's bright, but not offensively so. I'd rather call the overall effect \"convincing.\" Viewing the motion graphics at the beginning of Warner Brothers and 20th Century Fox productions, for example, felt like looking into the window of an uber-vivid metaverse.In a few instances, the color vibrance was so intense that some viewers might find it off-putting, such as the radioactive red glow of Netflix's logo. There are settings to reduce this intensity. For starters, you won't want to set the TV's picture mode to \"Dynamic\" because theneverycolor will gleam with supersaturated abandon. (I'll speak more on setting options below.)Adam Breeden/ZDNETOtherwise, I didn't encounter disproportionate levels of color or tonality. This held true in my assessments of glare and reflection, plus a scope of the QN90D's viewing angles. Standing just two feet from the screen at an unreasonably tight angle, the picture only suffered a minor loss of coloration (a slight washout), yet it retained its 4K QLED sharpness.I was equally impressed with this TV's audio output. Even in the absence of a connected soundbar, the volume managed to fill our testing area more than adequately, and it did this at about one-tenth of its potential. While watchingKandaharon Prime, I never pushed the volume past 12. It frightens me to imagine the stentorian result of cranking it up to 100.Also:Looking for Netflix shows? I used these secret codes to unlock the full catalogIn addition to 4.2.2 channel speakers pumping out 60 watts of power, Samsung's OTS+ technology tracks the onscreen action and adjusts sounds accordingly. Its 98-inch panel consists of 8,276 square inches, allowing for more integrated speakers, strategically creating a 3D-like soundscape that seems to envelop you from all directions. No soundbar is necessary. (Although I don't discourageadding one to it.)I did change the QN90D's default sound mode to \"Amplify\" and noticed a marked improvement in the crispness of whispering dialogue inDune 2andKandahar. The setting's name is a bit misleading because it doesn't amplify volume but clarity. The two films I mentioned above are excellent for TV testing. Like many movies, they have plenty of whispering dialogue but also gads of sweeping desert vistas.Color variation and rendering become more evident in viewing these mostly stark landscapes, which include everything from jutting rock formations to an actor's skin tone andDune'sreddish \"spice\" granules within swells of billowing sand. The bright and sunny drone shots inKandahar, for example, were particularly stunning.My ideal picture settings for the Samsung QN90DWhen orienting myself with any new TV, I spend a lot of time testing out the settings. I toggle the options on and off while scrutinizing select scenes from certain movies. I adjust the sliders if available (e.g., tint). I experiment with Expert Settings (like switching Local Dimming to high and Contrast Enhancer to low, and vice-versa).I do a similar thing with audio. This practice of combining and/or separating setting variables is basically a trial-and-error endeavor in pursuit of seeing optimal results. Naturally, this is a subjective process because it's all about personal preferences.Also:I changed these 6 Samsung TV settings to instantly improve the picture qualityFor the QN90D, I only changed three picture settings from their default positions, and that's in large part owed to the Tizen software's AI capabilities:Under All Settings, you'll find Samsung's \"Intelligent Mode\" option. Turning that on disables the usual lineup of options under the Picture Mode menu (Dynamic, Eco, Filmmaker, etc.).The Picture Mode options are then replaced with three choices: \"Optimized,\" \"Eye Comfort,\" and \"AI Customization.\" The latter indeed lets you customize your visual preference by selecting one of four image choices (each) for sports, movies, and general viewing.The Tizen OS's NQ4 AI Gen2 processor then used my image selections as ingredients to concoct what was, to me, the best picture possible.After all the experimentation, my selections solidified AI Customization as the clear winner in terms of a preferred picture mode. The contrast, brightness, and sharpness in scenes from these 4K flicks were incredibly satisfying.Adam Breeden/ZDNETConsider these design elements as you shopLike other new Samsung remotes, the QN90D's takes a little getting used to because of its diminutive size and its rocker buttons, which are relatively unconventional for remote controls. These small, flat, capsule-shaped buttons are designed to push toward or away from the TV to adjust the volume and navigate the menu. (The interface itself, I should note, only required a modicum of menu-diving to reach desired selections, making it one of the more user-friendly panels I've tested.)I acclimated to the remote's design swiftly, and I also appreciate the solar panel on its underside for a lifetime of use without cable charging or replacing batteries. But if it's just too much effort to pick up and use a TV remote, the QN90D also offers hands-free operation with its Bixby, Alexa, or Google voice assistants. Disappointingly, the remote is not backlit -- as I wish all TV remotes should be -- because I tend to do any binge-watching after sundown.Also:This TCL QLED TV I recommend has razor-sharp picture quality and a superpower for gamersA common complaint among users of the QN90D is the placement of its input array. Its four HDMI ports, two USBs, and other connection points are on the panel's back right side. This is fairly standard for many TVs. However, for a television of this size, simply accessing the ports and then deciding how to run your wires to the nearest wall outlet can be an awkward affair.These grumblings likely stem from prior iterations of Samsung's QLED models (e.g., the QN95C) having a separate OneConnect box that can marry all your peripherals to the TV through a single translucent cable. For the QN90D, the lack of a dedicated HDMI switch is a practical concern in terms of access and positioning. And it's an aesthetic consideration if you can't stomach visible wires trailing from the electronic centerpiece of your living room.ZDNET's buying adviceI can overlook Samsung's decision to make the inputs a tad harder to reach because this TV is spectacular to watch and listen to. At $15,000, even an ultra-large 98-inch screen ought to be brimming with cutting-edge technology, elevated specs, and a profusion of cool features. TheSamsung QN90Dcertainly qualifies with these traits, and right now, you can take advantage of a 33% discount.Most of all, though, it delivers an exceptional viewing experience that will dazzle your eyeballs and please your earholes.

And if you're working with a limited budget, that shouldn't mean you have to settle for a sub-par TV. Each TV model we review has been chosen across a variety of price points to help accommodate different needs.Screen size:The most important factor to consider, after price, when shopping for a new TV is whether or not it will fit into your space. While this specific screen size is exceptional, the QN90D is available in a wide variety of smaller sizes to suit different rooms.Picture and audio quality:A new TV doesn't mean much, even if it costs an arm and a leg, if it doesn't provide a great picture and clear audio. Each TV on this list has been ensured to support various HDR codecs, including HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, as well as enhanced audio software like Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, and object-tracking sound.For a more detailed look, check outour extensive TV testing methodology.Featured reviewsI replaced my iPad with a $100 Android tablet, and here's my verdict after a weekI found the world's smallest 65W USB-C charger, and it's my new travel essentialI tested the viral Roborock vacuum with a mechanical arm for a month - here's my verdictI replaced my OnePlus with this $700 Motorola flip phone, and it's spoiled me big timeI replaced my iPad with a $100 Android tablet, and here's my verdict after a weekI found the world's smallest 65W USB-C charger, and it's my new travel essentialI tested the viral Roborock vacuum with a mechanical arm for a month - here's my verdictI replaced my OnePlus with this $700 Motorola flip phone, and it's spoiled me big timeEditorial standardsShow CommentsLog In to CommentCommunity GuidelinesRelatedScore the 98-inch TCL Q65 TV for almost 50% off at Best Buy right nowThe LG C4 OLED is over 50% off right now - and trust me, it's worth every pennyThis LG C5 OLED for $400 off is one of my favorite TV deals, but it won't last long",

Amazon has recently discountedApple's M4 Mac Mini, and it's currently on sale for $500. That is a $100 price drop. Be aware that you will have to apply a coupon in order to get that lower price. Otherwise, you'll have to pay $549.$500 is noteworthy because it is the lowest the M4 Mac Mini has ever been. I strongly recommend taking advantage of the promotion if you're in the market for a new computer or looking to upgrade from a MacBook.Also:I test laptops for a living and these are the Memorial Day laptop deals I'd grab while you still canOther configurations are on sale, too. For example, theM4 Mac Mini with 16GB of memory and a 512GB SSDis retailing for $690. The24GB RAM and 512GB SSD modelcurrently costs $890. If you want better hardware, theM4 Pro Mac Miniis on sale for $1,190 at MicroCenter.Be aware that these prices do not include AppleCare+. Choosing the three-year warranty plan adds about $150 to the base model's price. The exact differs between models.ZDNET RecommendsApple Mac Mini M4 for $500 (save $100 at Amazon)$500 at AmazonRight now is the best time to buy the M4 Mac Mini, because, as stated earlier, $500 is the lowest it has ever been outside of major sales events and holidays. It's great to see the huge discount since this is a solid computer and one that comes highly recommended.According to ZDNET's Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner, theMac Mini M4 introduceda \"long-awaited redesign [to] one of Apple's quirkiest and most utilitarian products. \" It's more compact than the previous generation, weighing 1.5 pounds and measuring 5 by 5 inches.Hiner describes Apple's M4 chipset as providing \"next-level performance,\" enabling the computer to tackle challenging workflows like music production, video editing, and other forms of content creation. These applications are boosted by the fact that the base M4 Mac Mini comes with 16GB of RAM, compared to older Mac Minis, which sported 8GB of memory. That's fine for casual usage, but it buckles under demanding tasks. And with the introduction ofApple Intelligenceinto the mix, Apple had to give its hardware a much-needed upgrade.Also:I replaced my Windows PC with a Mac Studio for a week - here are my takeaways so farI recommend theMac Mini M4to people who want the latest Apple tech without the high cost. TheM4 iMacandMacBook Prodeliver a similar experience, but prices for those devices start at over $1,000.Looking for the next best product?

This compact desktop performs well thanks to its design. Plus, it delivers the next generation of Apple's AI tech.Because of the considerable price drop, ZDNET's rating system grants this promotion an Editor's deal rating of 2/5. $100 off is a pretty good price drop, so grab the small desktop while the deal is still hot.When will this deal expire?It's unknown exactly how long this deal will last as an expiration date wasn't given, but don't expect it to last for very long.

I also find this irritating, so if you want a \"quiet\" app, you might want to check out another option.Norton360 Virus Scanner & VPN features:Robust antivirus protection | Scam protection | Cloud backup | VPN | Paid plans |Google Play: 4.6 stars, 1.9M reviewsRead MoreShow Expert TakeShow lessWhat is the best Android antivirus app?To help you decide on the best Android antivirus app for you, consider the following factors:Android antivirus appPriceReal time protection?App protection?VPN?Google RatingBitdefender Mobile SecurityFree, $15 per yearYes, web protectionYesYes4.6 stars, 441K reviewsSophos Intercept XFreeYes, web filteringYesNo4.0 stars, 47K reviewsAvastAd-supported, free, $5.80+ per monthYes, web protectionYesYes4.6 stars, 7.33M reviewsMalwarebytesFree, $45 per yearYes, web protectionApplication managerYes4.6 stars, 499K reviewsNorton 360$30+ per yearYesYesYes4.6 stars, 1.9M reviewsShow moreWhich is the right Android antivirus app for you?Choose this Android antivirus app..If you want or need…Bitdefender Mobile SecurityThe best Android antivirus app overall.

However, there are other factors that need to be considered:Reputation: We only considered vendors with a solid reputation for putting security first. After all, an antivirus solution is worthless if it allows threats to slip through the net.Features: We like to see mobile antivirus apps offer a range of features including real-time scanning, alerts, advice and guides, and phishing protection.Ease of use: It's important that mobile antivirus apps are easy to use, especially as you tend to have limited screen space. We like to see solutions that are suitable for beginners and more tech-savvy audiences alike.Updates: It's important that app developers update their antivirus software apps frequently. Updates not only fix bugs and vulnerabilities discovered in the apps themselves but also generally include updates to virus signatures.Cost: We have included free and paid options. Not everyone has the budget to add yet-another subscription to their monthly or annual costs, but everyone should have access to mobile security.Show moreAndroid antivirus app FAQsDo Android phones need antivirus software?You don't necessarily need an antivirus app on yourAndroid phoneas long as it isn't rooted and you aren't downloading APKs outside of Google Play.Android has built-in protection, and the Google Play Store attempts to verify apps hosted on its platform for security issues. You shouldn't rely on just one tool or phone feature for decent security. We suggest a decent AV for another layer of protection as well as a VPN.Also:Best Android VPNs in 2025Show moreIs it worth paying for Android antivirus software?There is a range of paid and free Android security solutions out there. Whether or not you should pay for an app depends upon what you use your Android phone for.Free options will give you a basic layer of protection but if you need more advanced features -- such as real-time scanning and app monitoring -- you might want to go a step up. It's also advisable if you are more at risk of compromise than the average consumer, such as those in civil rights movements, politics, lawyers, and journalists.Also:Why you don't need to pay for an antivirus in 2025Show moreDoes antivirus slow down Android phones?Android antivirus solutions may slow down your phone, requiring power and memory resources to run. You will likely notice a slowdown, for example, if you are running a scan for viruses and malware. However, the best solutions shouldn't result in very noticeable power usage or changes to battery life.Show moreOther Android antivirus appsBest alternative overallESET Mobile Security AntivirusESET's Android mobile app provides excellent security through its impressive antivirus capabilities.View at AmazonBest optimization alternativeTrend Micro Mobile Security and AntivirusTrend Micro's Mobile Security and Antivirus app offers robust security and tuner functions.View at GoogleBest free alternativeMcAfee Security: Antivirus VPNMcAfee offers basic security for free but includes irritating notifications.View at GoogleBest user-friendly alternativeAVG Security and Virus CleanerAVG's Android app is user-friendly and unobtrusive, making it a great alternative.View at GoogleLatest updatesIn ZDNET's latest update, we performed substantial copy and layout changes.Show moreFurther ZDNET Tech CoverageSmartphonesBest Android phoneBest smartphoneBest Samsung phoneBest iPhoneBest rugged PhonesBest Google phoneBest foldable phoneBest flip phoneBest 5G phoneBest cheap phoneBest stylus phoneBest Motorola phoneSmartwatchesBest smartwatchBest blood pressure watchBest Garmin WatchBest Apple watchBest Android smartwatchBest Apple Watch Ultra strapBest waterproof smartwatchBest kids smartwatchBest cheap smartwatchBest sports watchTabletsBest smart notebookBest iPadBest drawing tabletBest small tabletBest large tabletBest tablet for readingBest tabletBest note-taking tabletBest KindleBest Android tabletBest tablet for studentsBest cheap tabletLaptopsBest laptop overallBest Linux laptopBest laptop for graphic designBest lightweight laptopsBest Lenovo laptopBest budget gaming laptopBest 15-inch laptopBest laptop under $1000Best Windows laptopBest laptop for video editingTVsBest TV overallBest 85-inch TVBest 50-inch TVBest Samsung TVBest Sony TVBest Roku TVBest 40-inch TVBest 75-inch TVBest 32-inch TVBest TV for PS5Best OLED TVBest Hisense TVOther Tech ResourcesIs Temu legit?

This clever accessory will give you an added level of securityElevation's Tag Vault keychain and security cable will protect your AirTag from the elements and from being removed.Written byAdrian Kingsley-Hughes,Senior Contributing EditorMay 28, 2025 at 11:20 a.m. PTZDNET's key takeawaysElevation's TagVault keychain and security cable are available now for $20 and $25 respectively.They're robust, made of hard composite fiber and quality fasteners, and fit AirTags perfectly, with no rattling.Enclosing your AirTags will inevitably reduce the volume of their chirping.$19.99 at AmazonI make no secret of the fact that I'm a hugeApple AirTagfan. These little disks have revolutionized my life, saving me hours of hair-tearing frustration when I hadn't put something back where it belonged.They've been a game-changer, the only downside is that it's not easy to attach a smooth, UFO-like disk to most things, necessitating some sort of holder. Apple got the ball rolling withtags for items such as keyrings, but it's the third-party market that has really stepped up and delivered on all sorts of creative and useful AirTag holders.Also:If you own an AirTag, you need these accessories to maximize its potentialOne company that has some of the best AirTag accessories is Elevation Labs. I first heard of this company when they introduced theTimeCapsule 10-year battery case. But they have a whole line of utterly creative and highly functional tags.ZDNET RECOMMENDSElevation Labs TagVault Keychain caseThis durable case is a great way to protect your Apple AirTag from the elements.detailsView at AmazonTwo tag holders that I've been testing recently are theTagVault Keychain CaseandTagVault Security Cable tags. The TagVault is the AirTag holder you need if you want to completely seal a tag from the environment.The tag is made from a durable fiber reinforced composite body and the two parts are held together with four stainless steel fasteners that go into metal threaded inserts in the case.Everything that comes in the kit -- except for the AirTag!Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETThe fasteners even have adab of threadlocking compoundin them to prevent them undoing by themselves.Threadlocking compound on the fasteners is a great touch!Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETWater and dirt and other muck is kept out using a silicone gasket, creating a little armored tank for your AirTag, that is still discreet and doesn't scream \"this is valuable, that's why I've attached an AirTag to it!\"Assembly is easy, just pop the tag inside the holder, snug up the four screws (no need to go crazy on them) and you're done. The tag holder has been designed to allow as much of the device's chirp out as possible -- the makers say the sound is cut by about a third, and my testing suggests that's about right.Also:Can you make an AirTag last 10 years? It took me a seconds to do itBut what about those times when you want to make it hard for a bad guy to take your tag off your stuff? This is where theTagVault Security Cabletag comes in.ZDNET RECOMMENDSElevation Labs TagVault Security Cable tagThis is a great tag for securing your tracker to cases and other bits of kit you don't want to lose.detailsView at AmazonThis tag holder is made of the same fiber reinforced composite has the TagVault Keychain Case, but this has an open-face design to keep the chirp from the AirTag as loud as possible. However, it is still IP68 rated for keeping the AirTag protected because it features a silicone gasket on the back that seals the battery compartment -- a neat feature.But this tag has some neat anti-tamper features, too. The cable used to attach it to items is a tough, polymer-coated braided stainless steel wire, and the tag is held together using a T10 Torx (screwdriver provided). Again, this Torx has thread locking compound pre-applied, which is a nice touch.Everything in the TagVault Security Cable tag kitAdrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETNot many people are going to be walking around with a T10 Torx screwdriver, but if you want to make things more difficult for a potential bad guy (and yourself when it comes to time to remove the tag or change the battery in the AirTag) then you can fill the Torx hole with nail polish, superglue, or even epoxy.This tag is sturdy and is capable of resisting pulling and twisting, and offers a great way to attach a tag to something and make sure it's not going to fall off -- either accidentally or deliberately. I've had one on my giantPeli Air 1615case loaded up to with over 55 pounds, and I could lift and drag the case about using the tag -- it's that tough.ZDNET's buying adviceThe tags can be bought as singles, a two-pack, and four pack, with theTagVault Keychain Casecosting $12.99, $19.99, and $37.99, and theTagVault Security Cablecosting $13.99, $19.99, and $24.99, respectively.Featured reviewsI replaced my iPad with a $100 Android tablet, and here's my verdict after a weekI found the world's smallest 65W USB-C charger, and it's my new travel essentialI tested the viral Roborock vacuum with a mechanical arm for a month - here's my verdictI replaced my OnePlus with this $700 Motorola flip phone, and it's spoiled me big timeI replaced my iPad with a $100 Android tablet, and here's my verdict after a weekI found the world's smallest 65W USB-C charger, and it's my new travel essentialI tested the viral Roborock vacuum with a mechanical arm for a month - here's my verdictI replaced my OnePlus with this $700 Motorola flip phone, and it's spoiled me big timeEditorial standardsShow CommentsLog In to CommentCommunity GuidelinesRelatedMy favorite USB-C accessory is only $8 but it can save you hundreds in repairsFinally, a portable SSD that's durable enough to travel outdoors with meI found a Bluetooth tracker to replace my AirTag, and it works with Android just as well",

It doesn’t come in a 128GB configuration, but the 256GB model is much cheaper at $50, plus it’s available in 512GB and 1TB capacities. It’s faster when it comes to sequential writes, measuring around 720 MB/s in CrystalDiskMark and 700 MB/s in ATTO. It also managed to write our larger test file in roughly 35 seconds in certain runs, which was notably quicker than the SanDisk card.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>However, its sequential reads were pretty definitively slower — even if they’re still far better than the rest of the market — and those are more important for reducing load times with the Switch 2 in theory. The improved sequential writes were also somewhat inconsistent: Sometimes it’d take closer to 50 seconds to finish our real-world test, bouncing between the low-200 MB/s range and the high-400 MB/s range along the way. At that point, it's only marginally faster than the SanDisk card. Random speeds, meanwhile, weren't hugely different, so both should be similarly adept at keeping larger games like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-perfect-launch-game-for-the-switch-2-130003924.html\"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>running smooth.</p> \n<p>In the end, the Switch 2 is the only real reason to buy a microSD Express card right now, and we can’t say for sure how different models will perform on that system just yet. The “best” option may end up being whichever one is cheapest. Nevertheless, the Play Pro is worth grabbing if you must buy an Express card today and want more than 256GB of space.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-samsung-pro-ultimate\">Samsung Pro Ultimate</h3> \n<p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0CF7Z68YH&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f411cada-3f1e-487d-8d9a-cb5d30c19fba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Samsung+Pro+Ultimate&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1NBTVNVTkctVWx0aW1hdGUtbWljcm9TRFhDLU1CLU1ZMTI4U0EtQU0vZHAvQjBDRjdaNjhZSD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmNDExY2FkYS0zZjFlLTQ4N2QtOGQ5YS1jYjVkMzBjMTlmYmEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vU0FNU1VORy1VbHRpbWF0ZS1taWNyb1NEWEMtTUItTVkxMjhTQS1BTS9kcC9CMENGN1o2OFlIIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdKkEmzv2nFgKOA4zCV_RQu1mww-hpn2BehdcHxvgG6t&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-Ultimate-microSDXC-MB-MY128SA-AM%2Fdp%2FB0CF7Z68YH\">Samsung Pro Ultimate</a> was the closest competitor to the Lexar Professional Silver Plus across our benchmark tests, but it's tangibly worse in terms of sequential write speeds, typically costs more and doesn’t offer a 1TB option.

But if you need more room — say, for stashing a bunch of games on a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719.html\">Steam Deck</a> — a 512GB card or greater could make more sense and often provides a better cost-per-GB ratio. These days, you can find a decent 128GB card for around $15, a good 256GB card for less than $30 and a solid 512GB card for around $40 (with faster models priced a little higher). There’s a starker increase when you go up to 1TB cards, which often cost closer to $100, though we’ve seen some fall into the $70 to $80 range more frequently over the last year. The first wave of 2TB cards are an even bigger leap: the 2TB <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f45797c5-bae4-4ba9-9419-9454e07b099d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f411cada-3f1e-487d-8d9a-cb5d30c19fba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=SanDisk&amp;linkText=SanDisk+Extreme&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3Auc2FuZGlzay5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbWVtb3J5LWNhcmRzL21pY3Jvc2QtY2FyZHMvc2FuZGlzay1leHRyZW1lLXVocy1pLW1pY3Jvc2Q_c2t1PVNEU1FYQVYtMlQwMC1HTjZNQSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjQxMWNhZGEtM2YxZS00ODdkLThkOWEtY2I1ZDMwYzE5ZmJhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3Auc2FuZGlzay5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbWVtb3J5LWNhcmRzL21pY3Jvc2QtY2FyZHMvc2FuZGlzay1leHRyZW1lLXVocy1pLW1pY3Jvc2Q_c2t1PVNEU1FYQVYtMlQwMC1HTjZNQSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASBP0YQCcAUG6Oj-X56Nk_kUHy8T7f5kuJt6UGHr3qA9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.sandisk.com%2Fproducts%2Fmemory-cards%2Fmicrosd-cards%2Fsandisk-extreme-uhs-i-microsd%3Fsku%3DSDSQXAV-2T00-GN6MA\">SanDisk Extreme</a>, for example, now has a list price just under $250.</p> \n<p>Note that a microSD card’s performance may differ depending on what capacity you buy.

Your device needs to support this for it to work with a microSDXC card. This will almost never be an issue these days, but some older devices (a <a href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/274/~/what-sd-cards-and-microsd-cards-are-compatible%3F\">Nintendo 3DS</a>, for instance) are only compatible with microSDHC (High Capacity) cards, which range from 2GB to 32GB.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/89014260-f038-11ee-bfd4-363a465ffda4\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-read-and-write-speeds\">Read and write speeds</h3> \n<p>MicroSD cards are primarily judged on their read and write speeds, which are usually measured in megabytes per second (MB/s). Generally, most microSD cards have faster read speeds than write speeds.</p> \n<p>These metrics can then be broken down into sequential and random performance. Sequential read and write speeds matter when you’re trying to access (read) or save (write) long, constant streams of data, such as opening a large video or copying a big batch of files from a PC. If you want to use a microSD card for media storage, this is particularly important. Random performance, meanwhile, is about how quickly a card can read and write small files scattered throughout the device.</p> \n<p>Since random read/write speeds are much lower than sequential ones, storage device makers tend not to advertise them as loudly. But they’re important if you use a card with a gaming device or a single-board computer like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/raspberry-pi/\">Raspberry Pi</a>, where it often has to rapidly save and access small bits of data in random locations.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/a8a00b60-f034-11ed-bf3c-39241bbedf2b\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-speed-ratings\">Speed ratings</h3> \n<p>If you look at a microSD card, you’ll see a buffet of numbers, letters and symbols. Most of these refer to the card’s <a href=\"https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/speed-class/\">speed class</a> and performance ratings, which are determined by the <a href=\"https://www.sdcard.org/\">SD Association</a>.</p> \n<p>A card’s Video Speed Class, or V-rating, details its minimum sequential write speed, which is especially important when recording video from a camera. It ranges from V6 to V90. Most of the cards we tested had a V30 rating, so they have a sequential write speed of at least 30 MB/s. This should be enough to support up to 4K video at lower bitrates. Higher-rated V60 and V90 cards are usually better for capturing 8K, but they come at a much higher cost.</p> \n<p>The UHS Speed Class, or U-rating, also refers to a card’s minimum sequential write speed. It comes in two varieties: U3, which mandates a minimum of 30 MB/s, and U1, which is rated for 10 MB/s.</p> \n<p>The older Speed Class rating overlaps with the other two systems. It’s signified by a C symbol and goes from Class 2 to Class 10, with the number (again) indicating minimum sequential write speed. This rating is less relevant nowadays, but you may still see a “C10” logo on some cards.</p> \n<p>The Application Performance spec, marked by an A symbol, is an indicator of random read/write speeds. This is measured in IOPS, or input/output operations per second, rather than MB/s. There are two categories here: A1 cards offer a minimum random read speed of 1,500 IOPS and a minimum random write speed of 500 IOPS, while A2 cards bump those up to 4,000 IOPS and 2,000 IOPS, respectively. Both ratings also guarantee sequential write speeds of at least 10 MB/s.</p> \n<p>To keep it simple, most people should look for a card with V30, U3 and A2 ratings. It’s totally possible to get a solid card without those: A U1 card might be worth it if you just need a cheap, high-capacity option, for example. V60 and V90 cards are worth a look if you’re serious about shooting high-resolution photos and video as well. But overall, cards with the certifications above should provide the best blend of price and performance today.</p> \n<p>It’s important to emphasize that these ratings are baselines. Most V30 cards offer significantly higher write speeds than 30 MB/s, for instance, and some A1 cards can outperform some A2 models in practice. The speeds advertised by manufacturers aren’t always 100 percent accurate, either: Sometimes the card will be slower in real-world use, other times it may actually be a bit faster.</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"The Samsung Pro Plus microSD card.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-04/97f08ea0-250e-11f0-97fd-d505a6f4e153\" style=\"height: 903px; width: 1499px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Samsung\n </div>\n</figure> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-uhs-bus-speeds\">UHS bus speeds</h3> \n<p>The other spec to note is the card’s bus interface. Most microSD cards available today are UHS-I, which has a theoretical maximum speed of 104 MB/s. There are also UHS-II cards, which have an extra row of pins on the back and can reach up to 312 MB/s. (A UHS-III standard technically exists as well but hasn’t seen wide adoption.) These are labeled on the card with a Roman numeral I or II.</p> \n<p>UHS-II cards are typically the ones with those higher V60 or V90 ratings. If you shoot lots of 4K to 8K video or frequently use burst mode to capture ultra high-res photos, the performance gains of a good UHS-II card can save you time.</p> \n<p>However, these are much more expensive than UHS-I cards: This <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f411cada-3f1e-487d-8d9a-cb5d30c19fba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBob3RvdmlkZW8uY29tL2MvcHJvZHVjdC8xNzkzMzcxLVJFRy9sZXhhcl9sbXNnb2xkMTI4Z19ibm5uZ18xMjhnYl9wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWxfZ29sZF9taWNyb3NkeGMuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjQxMWNhZGEtM2YxZS00ODdkLThkOWEtY2I1ZDMwYzE5ZmJhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBob3RvdmlkZW8uY29tL2MvcHJvZHVjdC8xNzkzMzcxLVJFRy9sZXhhcl9sbXNnb2xkMTI4Z19ibm5uZ18xMjhnYl9wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWxfZ29sZF9taWNyb3NkeGMuaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZCQLJCaXg-xEzPrC4Qb_Sfvns0Klfc_o4OPsadFGvTC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1793371-REG%2Flexar_lmsgold128g_bnnng_128gb_professional_gold_microsdxc.html&amp;refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2Fcomputing%2Faccessories%2Fbest-microsd-card-130038282.html&amp;uuid=6snSMKg4JwD8JRwW19544\">128GB Lexar Professional Gold</a> model, for instance, is a relative bargain at $35.

You need a device that’s compatible with the UHS-II interface to see any benefits, too, and stock for UHS-II cards is often spottier. For now, the higher speeds aren’t worth the price premium for most people, so we stuck mostly to UHS-I cards with our recommendations.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-02/eccbf260-edbf-11ef-affa-6baa4f7c8a62\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Unlike traditional UHS-I cards, a microSD Express card like the SanDisk model on the right comes with a second row of pins to enable its improved performance.\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Jeff Dunn for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-microsd-express-and-the-nintendo-switch-2\">microSD Express and the Nintendo Switch 2</h3> \n<p>The absolute fastest microSD cards you can buy, however, are based on a different interface called<a href=\"https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/sd-express-overview-in-short-videos-and-articles/\"> SD Express</a>.

That’s quicker than some older SSDs.</p> \n<p>It’s a substantial upgrade that has largely held up in our testing, but very few popular devices natively support SD Express today. The first major exception is the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2/\">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, which is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-nintendo-switch-2-promises-major-storage-upgrades-but-itll-cost-you-193758964.html\"><em>only</em> compatible</a> with the newer standard, as it’s needed to keep up with the performance demands of new handheld games.</p> \n<p>Besides SanDisk, manufacturers like Samsung, Lexar and PNY have already launched microSD Express cards to go with the console. The presumption is that having such a popular device embrace the tech will only further its adoption and drive prices down.</p> \n<p>But it’s still early days, and right now all microSD Express cards cost much more than the best UHS-I or even UHS-II options. Beyond the Switch 2, it’s possible to take advantage of these cards’ superior speeds with a dedicated SD Express card reader, but that adds even more to the final cost. It’s also worth noting that SD Express cards are not backwards compatible with UHS-II (or UHS-III), so if you try to plug one into a device with a UHS-II slot, it’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds. Still, they’re a must for Nintendo fans going forward, and the tech should have plenty of appeal if more gadgets that support the interface do arrive.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5b0bdf80-261b-11ec-93d7-3651390a7516\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-a-note-on-card-readers-and-reaching-advertised-speeds\">A note on card readers and reaching advertised speeds</h3> \n<p>While the UHS-I interface has a theoretical maximum of 104 MB/s, some UHS-I cards can exceed that speed through proprietary extensions. However, you need a compatible card reader and host device to take advantage of that extra performance. If you find a UHS-I card advertising speeds higher than 104 MB/s, this is what’s going on. You can see these limits in action with an original Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck: <a href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22481/~/microsd-card-faq\">Both</a> of <a href=\"https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech\">those</a> gaming devices support the UHS-I interface but don’t go beyond its official speed, flattening any sequential gains some cards may have elsewhere. (Differences in random read and write speeds can still matter, though.) The same thing will happen if you plug a more powerful UHS-II or SD Express card into a device that doesn’t accept those interfaces.</p> \n<p>The takeaway: Your microSD card will only be as fast as the slowest link in your chain.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-warranty\">Warranty</h3> \n<p>Many microSD cards are designed to be durable, with protection from water, extreme temperatures, X-rays and drops. Still, in case of catastrophe, a long warranty is always good to have. Many manufacturers offer lifetime or 10-year limited warranties, though we’ve noticed that “endurance” cards marketed to withstand more hours of writing are usually covered for a shorter period of time. For example, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f411cada-3f1e-487d-8d9a-cb5d30c19fba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;linkText=Samsung%27s+Pro+Endurance&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYW1zdW5nLmNvbS91cy9jb21wdXRpbmcvbWVtb3J5LXN0b3JhZ2UvbWVtb3J5LWNhcmRzL3Byby1lbmR1cmFuY2UtYWRhcHRlci1taWNyb3NkeGMtMjU2Z2ItbWItbWoyNTZrYS1hbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY0MTFjYWRhLTNmMWUtNDg3ZC04ZDlhLWNiNWQzMGMxOWZiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvY29tcHV0aW5nL21lbW9yeS1zdG9yYWdlL21lbW9yeS1jYXJkcy9wcm8tZW5kdXJhbmNlLWFkYXB0ZXItbWljcm9zZHhjLTI1NmdiLW1iLW1qMjU2a2EtYW0vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcllRIX3DZuYIbvhGrQFIv7FHWlCKx1-FShaN--m5dJQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fmemory-storage%2Fmemory-cards%2Fpro-endurance-adapter-microsdxc-256gb-mb-mj256ka-am%2F\">Samsung's Pro Endurance</a>, a model aimed at security cameras and other monitoring devices, comes with a five-year warranty.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-avoiding-counterfeits\">Avoiding counterfeits</h3> \n<p>The memory card market has had a particular problem with scammers selling fake products. To guard against this, only buy from a known brand and a reputable retailer such as Best Buy, B&amp;H Photo or Adorama. If you shop at Amazon, only buy if the shipper <em>and</em> seller is Amazon.com. (That said, a handful of users <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/dz3h6z/amazon_still_selling_fake_microsd_cards_even_if/\">have reported</a> receiving counterfeits even from Amazon directly in the past, so exercise caution.) Remember: If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of any retailer offering a significantly lower price than everyone else.</p> \n<p>Once you receive a card, check its packaging for any irregularities. You can run benchmark tests like <a href=\"https://crystalmark.info/en/\">CrystalDiskMark</a> or <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9ibGFja21hZ2ljLWRpc2stc3BlZWQtdGVzdC9pZDQyNTI2NDU1MD9tdD0xMiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjQxMWNhZGEtM2YxZS00ODdkLThkOWEtY2I1ZDMwYzE5ZmJhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAActngcAbGFJX7nyX4-HIJ1_WXXD3RN5G-OqiyGzawnQ0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fblackmagic-disk-speed-test%2Fid425264550%3Fmt%3D12\">BlackMagic Disk Speed Test</a> to verify its speeds aren’t drastically lower than what’s advertised (or possible, given its specs).

If you’ve got a device that still accepts microSD cards — whether it’s an oldergaming handheld, the newNintendo Switch 2, a dash cam, adroneor anAndroid tablet— we’ve scoured the market and put close to 20 top contenders through a number of benchmark tests. You can find our recommendations for the best microSD cards below, alongside some general shopping advice before you buy.Quick OverviewBest microSD card for most peopleLexar Professional Silver PlusMore options$40 at Amazon (512GB)$15 at B&H Photo$15 at AdoramaAnother good optionSamsung Pro PlusMore options$20 at Amazon$20 at B&H Photo$20 at SamsungA decent cheap microSD cardSamsung Evo Select$13 at AmazonThe fastest microSD card we've tested (which you probably shouldn’t buy yet)SanDisk microSD Express CardMore options$54 at SanDisk$54 at AmazonTable of contentsBest microSD cards of 2025Other notable microSD cardsWhat to look for in a microSD cardHow we test microSD cardsRecent updatesBest microSD cards of 2025LexarBest microSD card for most peopleLexar Professional Silver PlusStorage capacity: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB |Speed classes: U3, V30, A2, Class 10 |Warranty: Lifetime limitedA good UHS-I card is quick enough for most people’s needs, and theLexar Professional Silver Plusis the best value of the ones we’ve tested. Paired withLexar’s USB card reader, it consistently delivered faster sequential reads and writes than any other UHS-I model across our benchmark tests. It’s rated for read speeds up to 205 MB/s and write speeds up to 150 MB/s, both of which are relatively high to begin with, but we found the latter to reach into the 180-190 MB/s range in synthetic benchmarks like CrystalDiskMark, ATTO and AJA.Our 12GB test folder wrote to the card in 76 seconds on average, which was roughly 30 seconds quicker than the Samsung Pro Plus and Samsung Pro Ultimate, our two previous top picks. It effectively tied the Pro Ultimate to lead all UHS-I cards we’ve tried in reading that test file back to our PC. (That one averaged about 67 seconds, if you’re keeping score at home.) Both Samsung cards and a few others beat the Silver Plus in some random performance benchmarks, though it was still plenty competitive in that regard. Either way, it has all the requisite ratings — U3, V30, A2 — and it’s more than speedy enough for working with 4K videos or moving files between devices without major delays (so long as you have a reader and/or host device that can enable those max speeds).The card itself is waterproof with an IPX7 rating, and Lexar backs it with a lifetime warranty. Sizes range from 128GB to a spacious 1TB. Theoptional reader— which you can buy separately or as part of a bundle — is a bit large, but it conveniently includes both USB-A and USB-C ports, so you shouldn’t need any dongles to connect it to a phone or PC.What puts the Silver Plus over the top is its price. At the time of writing, a 128GB model is available for $15, while the 256GB, 512GB and 1TB variants were going for about $22, $40 and $85, respectively. Those aren’t the cheapest prices we’ve ever seen, and the math will change a bit if you need to factor in a card reader, but they either undercut or match competitors like the Pro Plus, Pro Ultimate or SanDisk Extreme despite the Silver Plus being the more performant card overall. So, to recap: It’s fast, it’s durable and it’s reasonably affordable. That’s the recipe for an easy recommendation.ProsFastest sequential read/write performance of any UHS-I card we've testedCheaper than many slower alternativesHas a 1TB optionLifetime limited warrantyConsNeeds USB reader to reach maximum speeds (as expected)$40 at Amazon (512GB)Explore More Buying Options$15 at B&H Photo$15 at AdoramaPhoto by Jeff Dunn / EngadgetAnother good optionSamsung Pro PlusStorage capacity: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB |Speed classes: U3, V30, A2, Class 10 |Warranty: 10-year limitedStorage prices tend to fluctuate, however, and theSamsung Pro Plus— our former “best for most” pick — is still worth considering if you see it available for several dollars less than the Silver Plus in the capacity you want. Its sequential read and (especially) write performance was slower than Lexar’s card across the board but still on par with or better than nearly every other UHS-I card we’ve tested. Its random reads and writes were generally second to the pricierSamsung Pro Ultimate, but only by a little, so it’s well-suited for a portable game console or any other setup where it’d be asked to access tiny bits of data scattered throughout a device. It’s held up perfectly fine in our long-term testing as well. That said, the Silver Plus is the better card when it’s in the same price range, plus Samsung’s has a shorter 10-year warranty.If you do end up grabbing one, though, make sure you get the newest model with read speeds rated at 180MB/s. An older-generation model with slower sequential reads and random performance may still be hanging around at some online retailers, so avoid that one. Samsung also sellsSonic the Hedgehog-themed versionsof the Pro Plus with identical performance ratings, but those usually cost a few bucks extra.ProsQuick sequential and random speedsReadily available at trusted retailersHas a 1TB optionConsSlower than our top pick, especially with sequential write performance10-year warranty isn't the longest$20 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$20 at B&H Photo$20 at SamsungPhoto by Jeff Dunn / EngadgetA decent cheap microSD cardSamsung Evo SelectStorage capacity: 64GB, 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB (\"new generation\" model only) |Speed classes: U3, V30, A2, Class 10 / (64GB) U1, V10, A1, Class 10 |Warranty: 10-year limitedTheSamsung Evo Selectis a clear step behind our top picks, particularly when it comes to sequential write speeds (just under 70 MB/s on CrystalDiskMark). So we don’t recommend it for any sort of camera. Still, it’s perfectly usable for simple storage expansion, and its sequential and random read speeds were still respectable in our benchmarks.Most importantly, it’s usually inexpensive: We've previously seen the 128GB, 256GB, 512GB and 1TB models fall as low as $13, $18, $33 and $70, respectively. The latter two capacities could be particularly fine values if you just want a giant chunk of space from a reputable brand on the cheap. That said, you should still grab the Lexar Professional Silver Plus or Samsung Pro Plus instead if either one is anywhere close in price.ProsOften discountedAcceptable performance if price is chief concernHas a 1TB optionConsSlower than other top picks, particularly in sequential write and random performance benchmarks10-year warranty isn't the longest$13 at AmazonJeff Dunn for EngadgetThe fastest microSD card we've tested (which you probably shouldn’t buy yet)SanDisk microSD Express CardStorage capacity: 128GB, 256GB |Speed classes: U3, A1, Class 10 |Warranty: Lifetime limitedLet’s be clear about this: Unless you plan to own aNintendo Switch 2in the near future, you almost certainly do not need theSanDisk microSD Express Card, or any other microSD Express card, just yet. Aside from Nintendo’s new handheld, devices that natively support this standard are exceedingly uncommon right now, and this particular card is highly expensive, starting at $56 for 128GB.Because microSD Express devices aren’t widespread yet, you'll likely need to buy a compatible adapter to see the improved speeds on a computer, which tacks even more onto the bottom line. The SanDisk reader we used for testing, for example,costs a whopping $112. Thereader we usedfor Lexar’s Play Pro, another new Express card, costs $100. At that point, you’re better off buying aportable SSDif you just want to stash and move files. To further that point, SanDisk’s card is only available in 128GB or 256GB capacities.AfewotherExpresscardswill offer more room for less cash, but most of those were either just released or aren’t yet available; we plan to test them for a future update. Plus, even if you do get a Switch 2, the prices today are probably as expensive as they’ll ever get. It also remains to be seen if the console will even allow for significant performance differences between cards. So if you can hold out, you should.Here’s hoping the Switch 2 does lead microSD Express to become more widely accepted though, because this thing is miles faster than any traditional card on the market. Sequential reads checked in just under 900 MB/s in CrystalDiskMark and ATTO, which was in line with SanDisk’s 880 MB/s rating and a fair ways above the Lexar Play Pro. Sequential writes topped out around 650 MB/s, right as advertised. Those write speeds only apply to the 256GB model we tested, though; SanDisk says they'll peak at 480 MB/s with the 128GB variant.Sustained performance isn’t always on par with those maximum speeds: With our larger test file, we noticed that write speeds would start around 530 MB/s then dip closer to 210 MB/s until the transfer was complete. Sure enough, SanDisk advertises minimum sustained write speeds of 210 MB/s for the 256GB model and 100 MB/s for the 128GB version. (Lexar’s microSD Express card behaved similarly, likely because these cards’ tiny frames can only handle so much before they have to throttle things down.) Still, this was quick enough to move the 12GB file to the card in 52 seconds on average. It took a mere 20 seconds to read the file back to our PC. The write test with our smaller 1.15GB test folder, meanwhile, averaged just 4.5 seconds.It all adds up to a card that's at least twice as fast as the best UHS-I models we’ve tested in terms of sequential read and write speeds, with three or four times the performance in some cases (particularly with the 256GB model). The gulf in random reads and writes was similar, and in some benchmarks even greater.That said, only those with a Switch 2 pre-order in place, cash to burn and/or a deep interest in new technologies should consider the SanDisk microSD Express Card right now. It is a genuine leap forward, but you’ll have to pay for it.ProsEasily the fastest microSD card we've tested, by any metricLifetime limited warrantyCompatible with Nintendo Switch 2ConsDevices that support microSD Express besides Switch 2 are extremely limitedExpensive, and requires a pricey reader to achieve full performance on most devicesOnly available in 128GB or 256GB$54 at SanDiskExplore More Buying Options$54 at AmazonOther notable microSD cardsThe Lexar Play Pro on top of Lexar's RW540 microSD Express card reader.(Jeff Dunn for Engadget)Lexar Play Pro microSD Express CardTheLexar Play Prois the second microSD Express card we’ve tested, and you can think of it as a \"1A\" pick next to SanDisk's model. It doesn’t come in a 128GB configuration, but the 256GB model is much cheaper at $50, plus it’s available in 512GB and 1TB capacities. It’s faster when it comes to sequential writes, measuring around 720 MB/s in CrystalDiskMark and 700 MB/s in ATTO. It also managed to write our larger test file in roughly 35 seconds in certain runs, which was notably quicker than the SanDisk card.However, its sequential reads were pretty definitively slower — even if they’re still far better than the rest of the market — and those are more important for reducing load times with the Switch 2 in theory. The improved sequential writes were also somewhat inconsistent: Sometimes it’d take closer to 50 seconds to finish our real-world test, bouncing between the low-200 MB/s range and the high-400 MB/s range along the way. At that point, it's only marginally faster than the SanDisk card. Random speeds, meanwhile, weren't hugely different, so both should be similarly adept at keeping larger games likeMario Kart Worldrunning smooth.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementIn the end, the Switch 2 is the only real reason to buy a microSD Express card right now, and we can’t say for sure how different models will perform on that system just yet. The “best” option may end up being whichever one is cheapest. Nevertheless, the Play Pro is worth grabbing if you must buy an Express card today and want more than 256GB of space.Samsung Pro UltimateTheSamsung Pro Ultimatewas the closest competitor to the Lexar Professional Silver Plus across our benchmark tests, but it's tangibly worse in terms of sequential write speeds, typically costs more and doesn’t offer a 1TB option. The Samsung Pro Plus is a bit slower for sequential reads, but it’s close enough otherwise and usually easier to find at a lower price.Lexar Professional GoldWe haven't used it ourselves, but if you’re willing to pay for a more powerful UHS-II card built for heavy-duty video recording, theLexar Professional Goldhastested wellelsewhere and should deliver significantly faster sequential write speeds than our UHS-I picks above. It’s one of the few UHS-II cards we could actually find in stock, but it’s pricey, with a 128GB model normally priced in the $35 to $40 range.SanDisk ExtremeTheSanDisk Extremeeffectively matched the Pro Plus in a few of our sequential tests, but that was partly due to us only being able to secure the 256GB model, which is higher-rated than the 128GB version. It’s a fine choice if you see it on sale at a reputable seller, but it’s broadly slower than our top pick and often costs more.SanDisk GamePlayTheSanDisk GamePlayperforms similarly to the SanDisk Extreme but costs a good bit extra as of our latest update. We couldn’t get it to reach its advertised speeds with the company’s own “Pro” card reader or other third-party options, so it fell short of our top picks.SanDisk PokémonTheSanDisk Pokémondoes outperform its advertised read and write speeds, but not by enough to outpace the Lexar Silver Plus or Samsung Pro Plus. It essentially charges extra for having a picture of Pikachu (orGengar, orSnorlax) on a product you’ll never look at.SanDisk Extreme ProTheSanDisk Extreme Prois a close analog to the Samsung Pro Ultimate but, as of this writing, is either unavailable at most trusted retailers or priced too high by comparison. The Lexar Professional Silver Plus has faster sequential write speeds as well.PNY XLR8 GamingThePNY XLR8is an affordable card that comes with up to 512GB of space. Its sequential and random writes speeds checked in a little bit above those of Samsung’s Evo Select, plus it comes with a lifetime warranty. But its sequential reads were much, much slower, putting it out of contention.PNY Elite-XThePNY Elite-Xoften goes for cheap and wasn’t too far off the random read/write performance of Samsung's Pro Plus in CrystalDiskMark. Like the XLR8, it’s also slightly above the Evo Select in write speeds. But its sequential reads were too far behind all of our top picks, and it no longer appears to be available in capacities above 256GB.What to look for in a microSD cardCapacityThe first thing to figure out when buying a microSD card is how much storage space you need. Modern cards are commonly available in sizes ranging from 32GB to 512GB, with several models now available in 1TB or1.5TB capacitiesas well. The first2TB cardsfrommajor brandshave started to arrive in recent months as well, which is exciting, but those are still fairly rare (and very expensive) by comparison.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementFor most, a 128GB or 256GB model should be a sweet spot between price and storage space. But if you need more room — say, for stashing a bunch of games on aSteam Deck— a 512GB card or greater could make more sense and often provides a better cost-per-GB ratio. These days, you can find a decent 128GB card for around $15, a good 256GB card for less than $30 and a solid 512GB card for around $40 (with faster models priced a little higher). There’s a starker increase when you go up to 1TB cards, which often cost closer to $100, though we’ve seen some fall into the $70 to $80 range more frequently over the last year. The first wave of 2TB cards are an even bigger leap: the 2TBSanDisk Extreme, for example, now has a list price just under $250.Note that a microSD card’s performance may differ depending on what capacity you buy. SanDisk says its128GB Extreme carddelivers sequential write speeds up to 90 MB/s, for example, while the higher-capacity models in the same line offer up to 130 MB/s.When we talk about microSD cards today, we generally refer to cards that use themicroSDXC (eXtended Capacity) standard, which have a capacity between 32GB and 2TB. Your device needs to support this for it to work with a microSDXC card. This will almost never be an issue these days, but some older devices (aNintendo 3DS, for instance) are only compatible with microSDHC (High Capacity) cards, which range from 2GB to 32GB.Read and write speedsMicroSD cards are primarily judged on their read and write speeds, which are usually measured in megabytes per second (MB/s). Generally, most microSD cards have faster read speeds than write speeds.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementThese metrics can then be broken down into sequential and random performance. Sequential read and write speeds matter when you’re trying to access (read) or save (write) long, constant streams of data, such as opening a large video or copying a big batch of files from a PC. If you want to use a microSD card for media storage, this is particularly important. Random performance, meanwhile, is about how quickly a card can read and write small files scattered throughout the device.Since random read/write speeds are much lower than sequential ones, storage device makers tend not to advertise them as loudly. But they’re important if you use a card with a gaming device or a single-board computer like theRaspberry Pi, where it often has to rapidly save and access small bits of data in random locations.Speed ratingsIf you look at a microSD card, you’ll see a buffet of numbers, letters and symbols. Most of these refer to the card’sspeed classand performance ratings, which are determined by theSD Association.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementA card’s Video Speed Class, or V-rating, details its minimum sequential write speed, which is especially important when recording video from a camera. It ranges from V6 to V90. Most of the cards we tested had a V30 rating, so they have a sequential write speed of at least 30 MB/s. This should be enough to support up to 4K video at lower bitrates. Higher-rated V60 and V90 cards are usually better for capturing 8K, but they come at a much higher cost.The UHS Speed Class, or U-rating, also refers to a card’s minimum sequential write speed. It comes in two varieties: U3, which mandates a minimum of 30 MB/s, and U1, which is rated for 10 MB/s.The older Speed Class rating overlaps with the other two systems. It’s signified by a C symbol and goes from Class 2 to Class 10, with the number (again) indicating minimum sequential write speed. This rating is less relevant nowadays, but you may still see a “C10” logo on some cards.The Application Performance spec, marked by an A symbol, is an indicator of random read/write speeds. This is measured in IOPS, or input/output operations per second, rather than MB/s. There are two categories here: A1 cards offer a minimum random read speed of 1,500 IOPS and a minimum random write speed of 500 IOPS, while A2 cards bump those up to 4,000 IOPS and 2,000 IOPS, respectively. Both ratings also guarantee sequential write speeds of at least 10 MB/s.To keep it simple, most people should look for a card with V30, U3 and A2 ratings. It’s totally possible to get a solid card without those: A U1 card might be worth it if you just need a cheap, high-capacity option, for example. V60 and V90 cards are worth a look if you’re serious about shooting high-resolution photos and video as well. But overall, cards with the certifications above should provide the best blend of price and performance today.It’s important to emphasize that these ratings are baselines. Most V30 cards offer significantly higher write speeds than 30 MB/s, for instance, and some A1 cards can outperform some A2 models in practice. The speeds advertised by manufacturers aren’t always 100 percent accurate, either: Sometimes the card will be slower in real-world use, other times it may actually be a bit faster.SamsungUHS bus speedsThe other spec to note is the card’s bus interface. Most microSD cards available today are UHS-I, which has a theoretical maximum speed of 104 MB/s. There are also UHS-II cards, which have an extra row of pins on the back and can reach up to 312 MB/s. (A UHS-III standard technically exists as well but hasn’t seen wide adoption.) These are labeled on the card with a Roman numeral I or II.UHS-II cards are typically the ones with those higher V60 or V90 ratings. If you shoot lots of 4K to 8K video or frequently use burst mode to capture ultra high-res photos, the performance gains of a good UHS-II card can save you time.However, these are much more expensive than UHS-I cards: This128GB Lexar Professional Goldmodel, for instance, is a relative bargain at $35. While that's less than many UHS-II models we’ve seen in the past, it's still more than double the common street price of our top pick above. You need a device that’s compatible with the UHS-II interface to see any benefits, too, and stock for UHS-II cards is often spottier. For now, the higher speeds aren’t worth the price premium for most people, so we stuck mostly to UHS-I cards with our recommendations.Unlike traditional UHS-I cards, a microSD Express card like the SanDisk model on the right comes with a second row of pins to enable its improved performance.(Jeff Dunn for Engadget)microSD Express and the Nintendo Switch 2The absolute fastest microSD cards you can buy, however, are based on a different interface calledSD Express. This hastechnically been aroundfor several years andnow includesits own subset ofspeed classes, but the gist is that it's much faster than UHS-I or UHS-II: SanDisk’s recently releasedmicroSD Express card, one of the first commercially available models, advertises sequential read speeds up to 880MB/s. That’s quicker than some older SSDs.It’s a substantial upgrade that has largely held up in our testing, but very few popular devices natively support SD Express today. The first major exception is theNintendo Switch 2, which isonlycompatiblewith the newer standard, as it’s needed to keep up with the performance demands of new handheld games.Besides SanDisk, manufacturers like Samsung, Lexar and PNY have already launched microSD Express cards to go with the console. The presumption is that having such a popular device embrace the tech will only further its adoption and drive prices down.But it’s still early days, and right now all microSD Express cards cost much more than the best UHS-I or even UHS-II options. Beyond the Switch 2, it’s possible to take advantage of these cards’ superior speeds with a dedicated SD Express card reader, but that adds even more to the final cost. It’s also worth noting that SD Express cards are not backwards compatible with UHS-II (or UHS-III), so if you try to plug one into a device with a UHS-II slot, it’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds. Still, they’re a must for Nintendo fans going forward, and the tech should have plenty of appeal if more gadgets that support the interface do arrive.A note on card readers and reaching advertised speedsWhile the UHS-I interface has a theoretical maximum of 104 MB/s, some UHS-I cards can exceed that speed through proprietary extensions. However, you need a compatible card reader and host device to take advantage of that extra performance. If you find a UHS-I card advertising speeds higher than 104 MB/s, this is what’s going on. You can see these limits in action with an original Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck:Bothofthosegaming devices support the UHS-I interface but don’t go beyond its official speed, flattening any sequential gains some cards may have elsewhere. (Differences in random read and write speeds can still matter, though.) The same thing will happen if you plug a more powerful UHS-II or SD Express card into a device that doesn’t accept those interfaces.The takeaway: Your microSD card will only be as fast as the slowest link in your chain.WarrantyMany microSD cards are designed to be durable, with protection from water, extreme temperatures, X-rays and drops. Still, in case of catastrophe, a long warranty is always good to have. Many manufacturers offer lifetime or 10-year limited warranties, though we’ve noticed that “endurance” cards marketed to withstand more hours of writing are usually covered for a shorter period of time. For example,Samsung's Pro Endurance, a model aimed at security cameras and other monitoring devices, comes with a five-year warranty.Avoiding counterfeitsThe memory card market has had a particular problem with scammers selling fake products. To guard against this, only buy from a known brand and a reputable retailer such as Best Buy, B&H Photo or Adorama. If you shop at Amazon, only buy if the shipperandseller is Amazon.com. (That said, a handful of usershave reportedreceiving counterfeits even from Amazon directly in the past, so exercise caution.) Remember: If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of any retailer offering a significantly lower price than everyone else.Once you receive a card, check its packaging for any irregularities. You can run benchmark tests likeCrystalDiskMarkorBlackMagic Disk Speed Testto verify its speeds aren’t drastically lower than what’s advertised (or possible, given its specs). You can also use software that’s designed to verify the true capacity and performance of your card, such asH2testwandFakeFlashTest.A few of the microSD card readers we've used for testing.(Jeff Dunn for Engadget)How we test microSD cardsWe've put about 20 microSD cards through a series of tests to verify their sequential and random performance. These included benchmarks likeCrystalDiskMark,BlackMagic Disk Speed Test,ATTO Disk BenchmarkandAJA System Test, as well as a few “real-world” tests. We copied and pasted a small folder of photos about 1.15GB in size to and from each card, then did the same with a larger 12.2GB folder containing multiple file types and subfolders, timing the process each time. We also checked how each card performed on the Steam Deck, downloading games of varying sizes — includingStardew Valley,Aperture Desk Job,Metal Gear Rising: RevengeanceandApex Legends— then timing how long it took to launch each game and load save files. We do multiple runs of each test to verify our findings and account for potential outliers.Where applicable, we used aKingston USB 3.2 UHS-II readerto test each card on both Windows 11 and macOS Sequoia. However, if a card could be bundled with (or is specifically advertised to use) a proprietary reader, we mainly tested with that, since we figure that’s the one most interested buyers will end up using. For Windows testing, we used an Alienwaregaming PCwith an Intel Core i9-10900F, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. For macOS, we used a 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro with an Apple M1 Pro chip, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. If a reader couldn’t connect over USB-C, we usedCalDigit’s TS4 dockto test the corresponding card on the MacBook.We tested the 128GB version of each card whenever we could, though we were only able to test higher-capacity models for a few options. We also reformatted each card before testing with the SD Association’sMemory Card Formatter tool.Recent updatesMay 2025: We’ve updated this guide to ensure our advice is accurate and to reflect the new Nintendo Switch 2’s use of microSD Express cards. We’ve also added testing notes for the Lexar Play Pro microSD Express card and the more standard PNY XLR8. We’ve removed mentions of a few cards that have seemingly been discontinued, including the original Kingston Canvas Go Plus, the Lexar Professional 1066x and the 2021 Samsung Evo Select. We plan to test more new microSD Express cards for a future update, plus a few other recent releases fromKingston,SanDisk,LexarandPNY.February 2025: We’ve updated this guide with a new top pick: the Lexar Professional Silver Plus. The Samsung Pro Plus, our previous recommendation, stays as a runner-up. We’ve also added SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card as a pick for those who want the absolute fastest card possible, albeit with heavy caveats. This is one of the first microSD cards to use the SD Express bus interface, so we’ve included more details on what that entails in our “what to look for in a microSD card” section. Lastly, we’ve removed our write-up for SanDisk’sApex Legendscard, as it appears to have been discontinued, and included testing notes for a couple of the company’s more recent releases.November 2024: We've checked back with this guide to ensure our recommendations are still accurate and made light edits for clarity.August 2024: We’ve updated this guide to note the recently released 1TB models for three of our top picks: the Samsung Pro Plus, the Kingston Canvas Go Plus and the Samsung Evo Select. We’ve also made sure all pricing details are as up to date as they can be.",

It was expected that the next major versions of iOS and iPadOS would be followed by the number 19, Macs would move onto macOS 15 and so on. That would continue the numbering system Apple has used for many years.That could be about to change, according toBloomberg. The next versions of the operating systems may be earmarked by the year, according to the publication's sources. That means we could soon see the debut of iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26 and visionOS 26.The numbers would align with the yearaftereach major OS release, since Apple typically rolls out the first public versions of those each fall. So the versions of iOS, iPadOS and so on that arrive this September or October may be named after 2026.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementWe'll know for sure whether this shift is happening on June 9, whenthe keynote of Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference takes place. It's widely expected that Apple will be giving its operating systems a major user interface overhaul to deliver a more unified experience across various devices.It seems like a wise move to align the branding of all of the various operating systems. The software powering Apple Watch devices is currently up to watchOS 11. Apple Vision Pro is running visionOS 2. It's a little messy as is. Applying the same numbering to all of the operating systems and aligning it with the release year should make things easier for everyone to keep up with.",

It starts at 5PM ET and will run for two hours.</p>\n<p>Organizers are promising &quot;spectacular new <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/gaming/\">video game</a> announcements, surprises and reveals.&quot; That's pretty compelling, especially since host Geoff Keighley (rightfully) <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/summer-game-fest-2024-what-to-expect-and-how-to-watch-games-revealed-live-165058094.html\">downplayed expectations</a> ahead of last year's show.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We do know about a few games that will appear. SGF Live will include a fresh look at <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, </em>a Soulslike action RPG from Leenzee, a studio based in China. That game will arrive in July. Open-world MMORPG <em>Chrono Odyssey </em>will make an appearance as well.</p>\n<p>Oh, and Hideo Kojima <a href=\"https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1927369398219661725\">will be there</a>, of course. SGF Live takes place just a couple of weeks before Kojima's  <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/death-stranding-2-just-got-its-release-date-and-a-10-minute-new-trailer-231240932.html\"><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></a> arrives, so we'll likely get another peek at that game.

One such event is the Wholesome Direct, which will feature around 60 cozy games. It will include world premieres, demo announcements and updates from publishers and developers including Playstack, btf Games, ustwo games and Wētā Workshop (whose <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cozy-lord-of-the-rings-game-tales-of-the-shire-is-delayed-to-july-213500109.html\"><em>Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of The Rings Game</em></a> arrives in July).</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-watch-women-led-games-showcase--june-7-1pm-et\"><strong>How to watch </strong>Women-led Games Showcase — June 7, 1PM ET</h2>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-watch-on-youtube\"><strong>Watch on</strong> <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@women-ledgames\">YouTube</a></h3>\n<p>This one does what it says on the tin.

Other titles in the showcase center around sustainability, and some are designed to raise awareness or drive action regarding environmental causes.</p>\n<p>Amazon Games, Skybound Games and Team17 are among those taking part. The stream will include a Q&amp;A about how games can inspire meaningful action on climate change.

That's one phrase you can definitely expect to hear, but <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/organizations/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a> will have plenty to share here. It's the biggest Xbox showcase of the year. There will be reveals and updates from across Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda and Activision Blizzard.</p>\n<p>Games that the company has in the pipeline include <em>Fable </em>(2026), <em>Perfect Dark, Gears of War: E-Day, Everwild, State of Decay 3, Clockwork Revolution, </em>Hideo Kojima's <em>OD </em>and <em>Contraband</em>. It feels a little early for an update on <em>The Elder Scrolls 6 </em>since that game is still years away. But we may find out more about those other games and some we don't yet know about, such as whatever Double Fine and Toys for Bob are working on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have my fingers crossed for more info on the <em>Blade </em>game that Arkane Studios is working on. It's a reasonably safe bet that we'll see something about the next Call of Duty here as well. There's always going to be space for offerings from Microsoft's partner studios and publishers too. Plus, you never know, we might get a peek at what <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-itself-to-halo-studios-120041943.html\">Halo Studios</a> has been cooking up.</p>\n<p>One game we'll definitely hear more about on June 8 is <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. That's getting its own time in the spotlight, with a dedicated event that will start as soon as the main Xbox Games Showcase ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Meanwhile, several publishers and other organizations are hosting their own shows around SGF. Here's when those will take place:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Access-Ability Summer Showcase (featuring games made by disabled developers and the accessibility options in each title) — June 6, 11AM ET, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@LauraKBuzz/videos\">YouTube</a> and <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/laurakbuzz\">Twitch</a></p></li>\n<li><p>IGN Live — throughout June 7 and 8</p></li>\n<li><p>Southeast Asian Games Showcase — June 7, 3PM ET</p></li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"2595d2f3c59a4c4cbd42513711708124\"></div>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Future Games Show — June 7, 4PM ET (featuring more than 40 games)&nbsp;</p></li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"d4329602764f45ab9abcffc942eff637\"></div>\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>PC Gamer</em>'s PC Gaming Show — June 8, 3PM ET (with 50-plus games)</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Phew.

Perhaps some of theotherprojectsKojima's working on will get some time in the limelight too.You can watch SGF Live on more than 20 platforms, including YouTube, Twitch, X, TikTok, Steam and international services. The event will stream live from the YouTube Theater, and you canattend in person, if you like.In any case, we'll be bringing you all the major news from Summer Game Fest Live. We just can't promise we won't have an adult beverage with an umbrella next to us while we're covering the event.How to watchDay of the Devs — June 6, 7PM ETWatch onYouTube(the same stream as SGF Live above) orTwitchImmediately after SGF Live ends, the YouTube and Twitch streams will segue into the summer 2025 Day of the Devs stream. Thisindie-focusedshowcase invariably has a fantastic lineup of games worth keeping an eye on.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementAmong the games making appearances arePossessor(s)from Heart Machine and \"nightmarish RPG\"Neverwayfrom Coldblood and co-publisherOutersloth.We'll also see something from House House (Untitled Goose Game) — presumably the co-op \"walker-talker\"Big Walkthat was revealed in 2023. In all, this edition of Day of the Devs will feature 20 games.Last year's show included 2024 game(s) of the year contenderUFO 50, the very intriguing platformerScreenbound, survival climbing gameCairn, the delightfully kooky-lookingBuilding Relationshipsand sci-fi mysteryPhoenix Springs. My Steam wishlist somehow expands quite significantly after each Day of the Devs showcase. Weird how that always happens.How to watchWholesome Direct — June 7, 12PM ETWatch onYouTubeorTwitchDefinitely don't overlook the smaller events that take place during SGF, as you can always find plenty of treats among them. One such event is the Wholesome Direct, which will feature around 60 cozy games. It will include world premieres, demo announcements and updates from publishers and developers including Playstack, btf Games, ustwo games and Wētā Workshop (whoseTales of the Shire: A The Lord of The Rings Gamearrives in July).How to watchWomen-led Games Showcase — June 7, 1PM ETWatch onYouTubeThis one does what it says on the tin. It's a showcase featuring games from women-led and majority-women studios. Women-led Games will feature 39 titles, including world premieres and release dates.How to watchLatin American Games Showcase — June 7, 2PM ETWatch onYouTubeThe Latin American Games Showcase will feature more than 50 games, all of which are from Latin American developers, oddly enough. Expect world premieres, game update news and more from this one.How to watch Green Games Showcase — June 7, 4PM ETWatch onYouTubeADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementThe Green Games Showcase is a new addition to the lineup for 2025. This will focus on the game's industry's \"growing commitment to the environment.\" It will feature games that make direct contributions to green initiatives. Other titles in the showcase center around sustainability, and some are designed to raise awareness or drive action regarding environmental causes.Amazon Games, Skybound Games and Team17 are among those taking part. The stream will include a Q&A about how games can inspire meaningful action on climate change. There will also be a fundraising drive to help plant 50,000 trees.How to watchXbox Games Showcase — June 8, 1PM ETWatch onYouTubeorTwitch(there's a separateASL stream on Twitchtoo)What's the over/under on the number of times the phrase \"day one with Game Pass\" will appear on this stream? That's one phrase you can definitely expect to hear, butMicrosoftwill have plenty to share here. It's the biggest Xbox showcase of the year. There will be reveals and updates from across Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda and Activision Blizzard.Games that the company has in the pipeline includeFable(2026),Perfect Dark, Gears of War: E-Day, Everwild, State of Decay 3, Clockwork Revolution,Hideo Kojima'sODandContraband. It feels a little early for an update onThe Elder Scrolls 6since that game is still years away. But we may find out more about those other games and some we don't yet know about, such as whatever Double Fine and Toys for Bob are working on.I have my fingers crossed for more info on theBladegame that Arkane Studios is working on. It's a reasonably safe bet that we'll see something about the next Call of Duty here as well. There's always going to be space for offerings from Microsoft's partner studios and publishers too. Plus, you never know, we might get a peek at whatHalo Studioshas been cooking up.One game we'll definitely hear more about on June 8 isThe Outer Worlds 2. That's getting its own time in the spotlight, with a dedicated event that will start as soon as the main Xbox Games Showcase ends.Meanwhile, several publishers and other organizations are hosting their own shows around SGF. Here's when those will take place:Access-Ability Summer Showcase (featuring games made by disabled developers and the accessibility options in each title) — June 6, 11AM ET,YouTubeandTwitchIGN Live — throughout June 7 and 8Southeast Asian Games Showcase — June 7, 3PM ETFuture Games Show — June 7, 4PM ET (featuring more than 40 games)PC Gamer's PC Gaming Show — June 8, 3PM ET (with 50-plus games)Phew.

In the end, the company offers enough capabilities to appeal to beginners and expert backyard pitmasters alike, although the Smoque isn’t as much of a value as it was a few months ago.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-basic-functional-design\">Basic, functional design</h2> \n<p>The Smoque may look like a smaller Searwood on the outside, but there are a few noteworthy differences. First, this model has a simplified controller that, like its predecessor, is only operated with a single knob. The smaller LCD panel is easily read from a distance, and it can show grill temperature, food probe temperature and timer info. The catch is the limited real estate can only display one of those stats at a time.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>This isn’t a problem if you’ve got the Weber Connect app handy, but you’ll want to be mindful of which item you leave on the screen if you’re planning to glance at the progress from across the deck. The company is actually hoping the limited onboard controls will encourage grillers to use the app on their phone more during the process. This isn’t a far-fetched scenario since the Smoque is more for smoking and roasting than high-heat cooking, but I’ll get to that in a bit.</p> \n<p>The other main difference between the Smoque and the Searwood is underneath the cooking grates inside. Weber replaced its trademark Flavorizer bars with a grease sheet that’s typical in most pellet grills. The Searwood has one large bar stretching from side to side, while Weber’s gas grills and the SmokeFire have several of them going front to back. The company opted for vents instead of a solid sheet of metal, and their covers are basically mini Flavorizer bars. This means you still get the effect of infusing flavor back into foods when grease and juices hit the hot metal and sizzle, albeit on a smaller scale. And those vents facilitate better airflow around the cook chamber, which means efficient smoke circulation.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-smart-grilling-features\">Smart grilling features</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"The Weber Connect app is where you can monitor and adjust the Smoque from anywhere. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-05/afbe62b0-3bd8-11f0-bfef-7a136ca45850\" style=\"height: 1263px; width: 2560px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Billy Steele for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>Weber Connect, a trademark feature of Weber’s smart pellet grills, is available on the Smoque via Wi-Fi. Once your grill syncs with your home network, the mobile software can be used to monitor ambient and food temperatures from anywhere. This is handy if you run out of pellets before your brisket is done or when it’s time to hit the school carpool line. You can set timers, activate SmokeBoost mode, add a temperature alert and initiate the shutdown process from the app, too.</p> \n<p>For beginners, or for cooks just looking for inspiration, the Weber Connect app also provides a wealth of recipes. Those come with step-by-step instructions, and the software offers readiness alerts so you don’t overcook those pricey cuts of meat. All of these software features have been a staple of Weber’s smart grilling lineup since <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-12-weber-connect-first-look-ces-2020.html\">the debut of the platform in 2020</a>. The company has greatly <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/webers-smart-grilling-app-now-lets-you-monitor-multiple-grills-at-the-same-time-150001446.html\">refined them</a> in the years since, and Weber Connect is now just as handy and reliable as Traeger’s WiFire tech, which I previously considered the gold standard.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-cooking-with-smoque\">Cooking with Smoque</h2> \n<p>Speaking of reliability, the Smoque is a barbeque workhorse in the backyard. Weber promises preheat times of under 15 minutes on the grill, and that holds true. In fact, most of the time the Smoque will arrive at the desired temperature well before that. Every time I use it, I’m shocked by how quickly it preheats, recovers from the lid being open and adjusts to a higher temperature. This is all thanks to the Rapid React tech in the controller, an upgrade that first appeared on the Searwood.</p> \n<p>During cooking sessions, the Smoque held its temperature reliability, too. The Weber Connect app has graphs for the various temperatures, and the ambient grill temperature trajectory is almost always a straight line. Sure, you’ll see the dips any time you open the lid, but you’ll also see the sharp incline that indicates how quickly the grill returned to the set temperature.</p>  \n<p>Like the Searwood, the SmokeBoost feature that’s designed to add more smoky flavor to your food only works at 180 degrees Fahrenheit. This is lower than you’d want to cook things like brisket or pork shoulders, so you have to plan additional cook time for the 1-2 hours at the lower setting. However, you don’t really need to use it all. The Smoque imparts plenty of wood-fired flavor from the pellets at the appropriate cooking temperatures. Ribs, pork butts, wings and chicken kabobs all had ample smokiness during my tests — even though the latter two items cooked at higher temperatures without using SmokeBoost first.</p> \n<p>A useful feature you’ll need to decide if you can live without on the Smoque is manual mode. Weber introduced this on the Searwood and the tool allows you to cook with the lid open for things like direct-flame searing and flat-top griddling. It makes that pellet grill more versatile, undoubtedly, but we’re talking about a more affordable, more streamlined model with the Smoque. As a result, that’s not available here.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-competition\">The competition</h2> \n<p>Both Weber and Trager have taken an interesting approach to their new smart grills in 2025. The companies have built options that are more affordable than previous devices, and the cheapest models from both of them start at $800. The Smoque was initially announced at $699, and Traeger now lists the Woodridge for $900 when it’s not on sale (<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DQTBRS3M&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=cb5c56c0-5fb4-47ed-992f-5b9f5f632450&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=it+currently+is&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRFFUQlJTM00_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiY2I1YzU2YzAtNWZiNC00N2VkLTk5MmYtNWI5ZjVmNjMyNDUwIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRFFUQlJTM00iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARjiSRzS__5nCRNvs-M_wJE_ieWxvJx6IFYqtB7xtJcz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DQTBRS3M\">it currently is</a>).

However, the temperature fluctuates during cooking on that grill, so I give a slight edge to Weber in a head-to-head matchup for its rock-solid consistency. And given the fact that the Smoque is now $100 cheaper at full price, those savings could go towards additional accessories.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2> \n<p>With the Smoque, Weber proves that a basic grill doesn’t have to offer a subpar experience. This model offers reliable smoking and roasting performance with smart features in the company’s app for less than its more robust Searwood model. The Smoque is even available in two sizes, so there’s an option if you need more than the 594 square inches of cooking space on the unit I tested. Weber really hit its stride with pellet grills last year with the Searwood, and Smoque is proof the company has more compelling ideas in the hopper. Thankfully, this one saves you some money without sacrificing any of the culinary results.</p> \n<p><em>Weber says the 22-inch Smoque is headed to retailers now and will be available on its website in early June for $799. The larger, 36-inch model is coming mid-summer for $999.</em></p>  \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/weber-smoque-review-a-simplified-smart-grill-thats-still-a-workhorse-160023349.html?src=rss",

For instance, there are function buttons below each thumbstick that allow you to swap between button configurations (which you can customize at any time in the PS5 settings). On the rear, there are switches that enable you to change the pull length of the shoulder triggers. There are also rear paddles, and you can choose between a set of levers or shorter half-domes.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>It's possible to swap out the thumbsticks as well and, because they attach to the controller magnetically, it's a cinch to do so. Other than the standard nubs, you can choose between short-stemmed convex and long-stemmed convex options.

It features deals aplenty on PlayStation 5 consoles, accessories and games, as well as PS Plus subscriptions. One of the more intriguing discounts is for the PS5 DualSense Edge. The premium controller has dropped by 15 percent from $200 to $169. That's the lowest price to date for the peripheral. The deal is available onAmazonandfrom Sony directly.The layout apes that of the regular DualSense controller, but there's a lot more going on with the Edge. For instance, there are function buttons below each thumbstick that allow you to swap between button configurations (which you can customize at any time in the PS5 settings). On the rear, there are switches that enable you to change the pull length of the shoulder triggers. There are also rear paddles, and you can choose between a set of levers or shorter half-domes.PlayStationPlayStation DualSense Edge Wireless Controller$169$200Save $31Sony's premium PS5 controller has dropped to $169, its lowest price to date, as part of the latest Days of Play sale.$169 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$200 at Target$200 at Macy'sIt's possible to swap out the thumbsticks as well and, because they attach to the controller magnetically, it's a cinch to do so.

Thelatest versionlets you use a keyboard shortcut to open a pop-up that previews a link's contents when you hover over it from any web page. It's a new way that AI is being integrated into browsers that may help users but hurt publishers.To try the new feature you need the latest Firefox release channel version 139.0. Within the settings under \"Firefox Labs,\" simply turn on Link Previews. \"After enabling, use the Alt+Shift keyboard shortcut when hovering over a link to see the previews in action,\" Mozilla writes.Once turned on, you can hover your mouse over a link on any webpage and a vertical window will pop up showing an image on top, the publisher's link and a quick summary. Below that are AI-generated \"key points\" that provide further information. Mozillapreviously saidthat it uses the SmolLM2-360M language model from Hugging Face, on-device with Reader's View content to ensure privacy.Link Previews first came along last month in beta but is now widely available in some regions. Like Google's AI previews, it could risk harming publishers by reducing traffic (which is likely why neither of those features are available in France where I live). It's also not clear if Firefox is paying publishers to use their information in AI-powered summaries.",

    "content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage.Learn MoreTherecent takedown of DanaBot, a Russian malware platform responsible for infecting over300,000 systemsand causing more than$50 millionin damage, highlights how agentic AI is redefining cybersecurity operations.According to a recent Lumen Technologies post, DanaBot actively maintained an average of150 active C2 servers per day, with roughly1,000 dailyvictims across more than 40 countries.Last week, the U.S.Department of Justiceunsealed a federal indictmentin Los Angeles against 16 defendants of DanaBot, a Russia-based malware-as-a-service (MaaS) operation responsible for orchestrating massive fraud schemes, enabling ransomware attacks and inflicting tens of millions of dollars in financial losses to victims.DanaBot first emerged in 2018 as a banking trojan but quickly evolved into a versatile cybercrime toolkit capable of executing ransomware, espionage and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns. The toolkit’s ability to deliver precise attacks on critical infrastructure has made it a favorite of state-sponsored Russian adversaries with ongoing cyber operations targeting Ukrainian electricity, power and water utilities.DanaBot sub-botnetshave beendirectly linked to Russian intelligence activities, illustrating the merging boundaries between financially motivated cybercrime and state-sponsored espionage. DanaBot’s operators,SCULLY SPIDER, faced minimal domestic pressure from Russian authorities, reinforcing suspicions that the Kremlin either tolerated or leveraged their activities as a cyber proxy.As illustrated in the figure below, DanaBot’s operational infrastructure involved complex and dynamically shifting layers of bots, proxies, loaders and C2 servers, making traditional manual analysis impractical.Overview of DanaBot pipeline and management infrastructure. Source: Team Cymru and Lumen TechnologiesDanaBot shows why agentic AI is the new front line against automated threatsAgentic AI played a central role in dismantling DanaBot, orchestrating predictive threat modeling, real-time telemetry correlation, infrastructure analysis and autonomous anomaly detection. These capabilities reflect years of sustained R&D and engineering investment by leading cybersecurity providers, who have steadily evolved from static rule-based approaches to fully autonomous defense systems.“DanaBot is a prolific malware-as-a-service platform in the eCrime ecosystem, and its use by Russian-nexus actors for espionage blurs the lines between Russian eCrime and state-sponsored cyber operations,” Adam Meyers, Head of Counter Adversary Operations,CrowdStriketold VentureBeat in a recent interview. “SCULLY SPIDER operated with apparent impunity from within Russia, enabling disruptive campaigns while avoiding domestic enforcement. Takedowns like this are critical to raising the cost of operations for adversaries.”Taking down DanaBot validated agentic AI’s value for Security Operations Centers (SOC) teams by reducingmonths of manual forensic analysis into a few weeks. All that extra time gave law enforcement the time they needed to identify and dismantle DanaBot’s sprawling digital footprint quickly.DanaBot’s takedown signals a significant shift in the use of agentic AI in SOCs. SOC Analysts are finally getting the tools they need to detect, analyze, and respond to threats autonomously and at scale, attaining the greater balance of power in the war against adversarial AI.DanaBot takedown proves SOCs must evolve beyond static rules to agentic AIDanaBot’s infrastructure, dissected byLumen’s Black Lotus Labs, reveals the alarming speed and lethal precision of adversarial AI. Operating over 150 active command-and-control servers daily, DanaBot compromised roughly 1,000 victims per day across more than 40 countries, including the U.S. and Mexico. Its stealth was striking. Only 25% of its C2 servers registered onVirusTotal, effortlessly evading traditional defenses.Built as a multi-tiered, modular botnet leased to affiliates, DanaBot rapidly adapted and scaled, rendering static rule-based SOC defenses, including legacy SIEMs and intrusion detection systems, useless.CiscoSVP Tom Gillis emphasized this risk clearly in a recent VentureBeat interview. “We’re talking about adversaries who continually test, rewrite and upgrade their attacks autonomously. Static defenses can’t keep pace. They become obsolete almost immediately.”The goal is to reduce alert fatigue and accelerate incident responseAgentic AI directly addresses a long-standing challenge, starting with alert fatigue. Traditional SIEM platforms burden analysts with up to40% false-positive rates.By contrast, agentic AI-driven platforms significantly reduce alert fatigue through automated triage, correlation and context-aware analysis. These platforms include: Cisco Security Cloud, CrowdStrike Falcon, Google Chronicle Security Operations, IBM Security QRadar Suite, Microsoft Security Copilot, Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSIAM, SentinelOne Purple AI and Trellix Helix. Each platform leverages advanced AI and risk-based prioritization to streamline analyst workflows, enabling rapid identification and response to critical threats while minimizing false positives and irrelevant alerts.Microsoft research reinforces this advantage, integrating gen AI into SOC workflows and reducing incident resolution timeby nearly one-third. Gartner’s projections underscore the transformative potential of agentic AI, estimating a productivity leap of approximately40%for SOC teams adopting AI by 2026.“The speed of today’s cyberattacks requires security teams to rapidly analyze massive amounts of data to detect, investigate, and respond faster. Adversaries are setting records, with breakout times of just over two minutes, leaving no room for delay,” George Kurtz, president, CEO and co-founder of CrowdStrike, toldVentureBeatduring a recent interview.How SOC leaders are turning agentic AI into operational advantageDanaBot’s dismantling signals a broader shift underway: SOCs are moving from reactive alert-chasing to intelligence-driven execution. At the center of that shift is agentic AI. SOC leaders getting this right aren’t buying into the hype. They’re taking deliberate, architecture-first approaches that are anchored in metrics and, in many cases, risk and business outcomes.Key takeaways of how SOC leaders can turn agentic AI into an operational advantage include the following:Start small. Scale with purpose.High-performing SOCs aren’t trying to automate everything at once. They’re targeting high-volume, repetitive tasks that often include phishing triage, malware detonation, routine log correlation and proving value early. The result: measurable ROI, reduced alert fatigue, and analysts reallocated to higher-order threats.Integrate telemetry as the foundation, not the finish line.The goal isn’t collecting more data, it’s making telemetry meaningful. That means unifying signals across endpoint, identity, network, and cloud to give AI the context it needs. Without that correlation layer, even the best models under-deliver.Establish governance before scale.As agentic AI systems take on more autonomous decision-making, the most disciplined teams are setting clear boundaries now. That includes codified rules of engagement, defined escalation paths and full audit trails. Human oversight isn’t a backup plan, and it’s part of the control plane.Tie AI outcomes to metrics that matter.The most strategic teams align their AI efforts to KPIs that resonate beyond the SOC: reduced false positives, faster MTTR and improved analyst throughput. They’re not just optimizing models; they’re tuning workflows to turn raw telemetry into operational leverage.Today’s adversaries operate at machine speed, and defending against them requires systems that can match that velocity. What made the difference in the takedown of DanaBot wasn’t generic AI. It was agentic AI, applied with surgical precision, embedded in the workflow, and accountable by design.Daily insights on business use cases with VB DailyIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

    "content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage.Learn MoreResearchers atUniversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaignhave introduceds3, an open-source framework designed to build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems more efficiently than current methods.s3 can benefit developers creating real-world large language model (LLM) applications, as it simplifies and reduces the cost of creating retriever models within RAG architectures.RAG retrievalThe effectiveness of any RAG system hinges on the quality of its retrieval component. Intheir paper, the researchers categorize the evolution ofRAGapproaches into three distinct phases.“Classic RAG” systems rely on static retrieval methods with fixed queries, where retrieval quality is disconnected from the ultimate generation performance. These architectures struggle with queries requiring contextual or multi-hop reasoning.A subsequent phase, dubbed “Pre-RL-Zero,” introduces more active LLM participation during inference. These techniques involved multi-turn interactions, interleaving query generation, retrieval, and reasoning. However, they typically depend on zero-shot prompting and lack trainable components to optimize retrieval through direct outcome signals.The most recent phase, “RL-Zero,” leveragesreinforcement learning(RL) to train models to act as search agents, improving through outcome-based feedback like answer correctness. An example isSearch-R1, which trains the model to interleave reasoning with search queries and retrieved context.Despite their advancements, existing RL-Zero approaches often optimize retrieval using search-centric metrics that ignore downstream utility. Moreover, they requirefine-tuning the LLM, which is costly and error-prone. By entangling retrieval with generation, they limit real search utility and compatibility with frozen or proprietary models.Different types of RAG Source: arXivAs the researchers put it, “This motivates a shift toward a modular framework where search and generation are cleanly separated, and optimization focuses purely on search quality with respect to downstream utility.”s3The s3 framework addresses this challenge with a model-agnostic approach. The main idea is to train a search agent with structured, multi-turn access to external knowledge. This search agent improves the quality of the retrieval stage without affecting the LLM that generates the final answer.In s3, a dedicated searcher LLM iteratively interacts with a search engine. It generates queries based on the prompt, retrieves relevant documents, selects a useful subset of evidence, and decides whether to continue searching for more information. Once the search concludes, a separate, frozen generator LLM consumes this accumulated evidence to produce the final answer.s3 framework Source: arXivA core innovation of s3 is its reward signal, Gain Beyond RAG (GBR). GBR quantifies the improvement in the generator’s accuracy when conditioned on documents retrieved by s3, compared to a baseline that retrieves the top documents matching the query. This reward incentivizes the searcher to find documents that truly enhance the generator’s output quality.“s3 decouples the retriever (searcher) from the generator. This lets companies plug in any off-the-shelf or proprietary LLM—whether GPT-4, Claude, or an internal model—without having to fine-tune it,” Patrick (Pengcheng) Jiang, lead author of the paper and doctoral student at UIUC, told VentureBeat. “For enterprises with regulatory or contractual constraints on model modification, or those that rely on closed-source LLM APIs, this modularity makes s3 highly practical. It allows them to enhance search quality without touching their generation infrastructure.”s3 in actionThe researchers tested s3 across six general-domain question-answering benchmarks, comparing it against three categories of RAG systems: End-to-end fine-tuning (e.g., Search-R1), static retrieval with frozen generators (such as classic RAG pipelines) and active retrieval with frozen generators (e.g., combining documents obtained by Search-R1 with a frozen LLM). In their experiments, they used Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the base model for the searcher and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct andClaude 3 Haikuas the frozen generator LLMs.s3 surpassed static, zero-shot and end-to-end tuned baselines on most benchmarks and achieved an average score. Its data efficiency is particularly noteworthy: s3 achieved strong gains with only 2.4k training examples, significantly less than the 70k examples required by DeepRetrieval (a static retrieval framework) or the 170k needed by Search-R1, while outperforming both in context quality and final answer performance.s3 vs other RAG techniques Source: GitHub“Many enterprises lack large-scale annotated QA datasets or the GPU infrastructure to fine-tune end-to-end LLM systems. s3 lowers the barrier by enabling strong retrieval performance with minimal supervision and compute,” Jiang said. “This means faster prototyping, reduced costs and quicker time-to-deployment for AI-powered search applications.”The findings suggest a fundamental shift in optimization strategy. As the researchers note in the paper, most of the performance gain in RAG stems from “improving the search capability instead of aligning generation outputs,” which implies that focusing RL on search strategy rather than combined generation alignment yields better results.Another crucial finding for enterprise applications is s3’s ability to generalize to domains it has not been trained on. s3 showed zero-shot success on medical QA despite training only on general QA, suggesting that “reinforcement-learned search skills generalize more reliably than generation-tuned approaches,” according to the researchers.This cross-domain adaptability makes s3 well-suited for specialized enterprise applications that often deal with proprietary or bespoke datasets without requiring extensive domain-specific training data. This means that a single trained searcher could serve different departments (e.g., legal, HR, customer support) or adapt to evolving content such as new product documents.“We see immediate potential in healthcare, enterprise knowledge management, and scientific research support, where high retrieval quality is critical and labeled data is often scarce,” Jiang said.Daily insights on business use cases with VB DailyIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

The dimensions of our embeddings are ordered by relevance. For any integer target dimension n, you can choose to keep the first n dimensions for a smooth trade-off between quality and cost.”Mistral tested the model on several benchmarks, including SWE-Bench and Text2Code from GitHub. In both cases, the company said Codestral Embed outperformed leading embedding models.SWE- BenchText2CodeUse casesMistral said Codestral Embed is optimized for “high-performance code retrieval” and semantic understanding. The company said the code works best for at least four kinds of use cases: RAG, semantic code search, similarity search and code analytics.Embedding models generally target RAG use cases, as they can facilitate faster information retrieval for tasks or agentic processes. Therefore, it’s not surprising that Codestral Embed would focus on that.The model can also perform semantic code search, allowing developers to find code snippets using natural language. This use case works well for developer tool platforms, documentation systems and coding copilots. Codestral Embed can also help developers identify duplicated code segments or similar code strings, which can be helpful for enterprises with policies regarding reused code.The model supports semantic clustering, which involves grouping code based on its functionality or structure. This use case would help analyze repositories, categorize and find patterns in code architecture.Competition is increasing in the embedding spaceMistral has been on a roll with releasingnew models and agentic tools. It released Mistral Medium 3, a medium version of its flagship large language model (LLM), which currently powers its enterprise-focused platform Le Chat Enterprise.It also announced the Agents API, which allows developers to access tools for creating agents that perform real-world tasks and orchestrate multiple agents.Mistral’s moves to offer more model options to developers have not gone unnoticed in developer spaces. Some on X note that Mistral’s timing in releasing Codestral Embed is “coming on the heels of increased competition.”Mistral AI Just Dropped a Game-Changer: Codestral Embed Crushes OpenAI and Google in Code Search RaceFrench AI startup Mistral AI has quietly unleashed what could be the most significant breakthrough in code intelligence this year.

Another entry on the long list of surreal moments that your support has made real. Thank you ALL.” Kepler portfolio director Matthew Handrahan said inan interview with GamesIndustry.bizthat the game’s relatively short length — “One of the things that’s great about Expedition 33 is it really respects the player’s time,” he said — makes it a more appealing value proposition than other games of a similar or higher price point.Expedition 33 has achieved this success despite not coming from an established franchise and being developed by an indie studio. It also launched within the same window as Virtuos’s remaster of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, which was the best-selling game of April (according to Circana). Despite this, the two game don’t appear to have stolen too much sales attention from each other, and Bethesda even celebrated the launch of the other studio’s game with an image of Oblivion’s Adoring Fan playing the game.GB DailyStay in the know!

    "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang tiptoed into politics with a comment taking a shot at theU.S. policythat has cut off sales of his chips to China.That was because Nvidia had to take a $4.5 billion charge against its Q1 earnings because the company had to immediately cease selling H20 AI chips to China in April. U.S. President Donald Trump imposed the restrictions as part of the trade war over tariffs with China and other countries.“Let me share my perspective on some topics we’re frequently asked on export control. China is one of the world’s largest AI markets and a springboard to global success with half of the world’s AI researchers based there,” Huang said. “The platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally today. However, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry. The H20 export ban ended our Hopper data center business in China. We cannot produce Hopper further to comply. As a result, we are taking a multibillion-dollar write-off on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed. We are exploring limited ways to compete, but hopper is no longer an option.”Huang said that, with or without U.S. chips, China has to compute to train and deploy advanced models.“The question is not whether China will have it. It already does,” he said. “The question is whether one of the world’s largest AI markets will run on American platforms. Shielding Chinese chip makers from U.S. competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens America’s position.”He added, “Export restrictions have spurred China’s” competitiveness. He said, “The race is not just about chips. It’s about which stack the world runs as that stack grows. Global infrastructure leadership is at stake. The U.S. has based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make any chips. That assumption was always questionable, and now it’s very wrong. China has enormous manufacturing capability. In the end, the platform that wins the AI developers wins AI. AI export controls should strengthen U.S. platforms, not drive half the world’s AI talent” to other shores.While Huang was critical of policy changes, he also said, “It’s really terrific to see the AI diffusion rule was rescinded. President Trump wants America to win and realizes we are not the only country in the race. And he realizes we have to get the American stack out to the world.”Huang was referencing the Biden-era AI Diffusion Rule, which was rescinded in May 2025, just before it was set to take effect. Biden’s administration aimed to place export controls on AI model weights and advanced computing integrated circuits (ICs), potentially restricting the global diffusion of AI technology.But the Trump administration argued that the rule would stifle American AI innovation.The rescission of the AI Diffusion Rule could potentially benefit countries like Saudi Arabia and U.S. AI companies by easing restrictions on AI technology exports. However, the Trump administration indicated they would pursue a strategy to promote American AI technology with trusted allies, while still aiming to block access to adversaries.Huang said, “The president has a plan. He has a vision. And I trust him.” But he added, “The new limits are the end of the road for Hopper.”GB DailyStay in the know!

    "content": "Nvidia, the AI and graphics chip company driving societal changes with AI, reported revenue for the first quarter ended April 27, 2025, was $44.1 billion, up 12% from the previous quarter and up 69% from a year ago.On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government told Nvidia that a license is required for exports of its H20 products into the China market. As a result of these new requirements, Nvidia incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished. In after-hours trading, Nvidia’s stock is up 4.4%.Sales of H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 prior to the new export licensing requirements. Nvidia was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter. Excluding the $4.5 billion charge, first quarter non-GAAP gross margin would have been 71.3%.NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen HuangFor the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.76 and $0.81, respectively. Excluding the $4.5 billion charge and related tax impact, first quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been 96 cents. Analysts expected net income of 75 cents a share on Q1 revenue of $43.2 billion.“Our breakthrough Blackwell NVL72 AI supercomputer — a ‘thinking machine’ designed for reasoning— is now in full-scale production across system makers and cloud service providers,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, in a statement. “Global demand for Nvidia’s AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure — just like electricity and the internet — and Nvidia stands at the center of this profound transformation.”Nvidia shareholders got a scare when DeepSeek emerged. Back on January 27, Nvidia’s stock fell 17%, losing $600 billion in market value, after investors worried that DeepSeek’s efficient AI models might reduce the demand for Nvidia’s high-margin AI hardware. But the stock has recovered since that time.Nvidia downplayed the concerns and during the quarter announced a number of new products during the Computex trade show in Taiwan last week.In its outlook for the second quarter, Nvidia said it expects revenues to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. This reflects a loss in H20 revenue of $8 billion due to the export control limitations.GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.8% and 72.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The company is continuing to work toward achieving gross margins in the mid-70% range late this year.GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. Full year fiscal 2026 operating expense growth is expected to be in the mid-30% range.Data Center revenuesNvidia powers the world’s most powerful quantum research supercomputer.First-quarter revenue was $39.1 billion, up 10% from the previous quarter and up 73% from a year ago.Nvidia announced it is building factories in the U.S. and working with its partners to produce Nvidia AI supercomputers in the U.S.It also introduced Nvidia Blackwell Ultra and Nvidia Dynamo for accelerating and scaling AI reasoning models. And it announced a partnership with HUMAIN to build AI factories in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to drive the next wave of artificial intelligence development.Also in the Middle East, it unveiled Stargate UAE, a next-generation AI infrastructure cluster in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, alongside strategic partners G42, OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank Group and Cisco.The company said it plans to work with Foxconn and the Taiwan government to build an AI factory supercomputer. It also announced joint initiatives with Alphabet and Google to advance agentic AI solutions, robotics and drug discovery.And it revealed that Nvidia Blackwell cloud instances are now available on AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.Gaming and AI PCWarhamer 40,000: Space Marine 2 gets a big speed boost with RTX 5060 over RTX 3060.First-quarter gaming revenue was a record $3.8 billion, up 48% from the previous quarter and up 42% from a year ago.Nvidia also announced the GeForce RTX 5070 and RTX 5060, bringing Blackwell graphics to gamers at prices starting from $299 for desktops and $1,099 for laptops.“Strong adoption by gamers have made Blackwell fastest ramp ever,” said Colette Kress, CFO of Nvidia, in an analyst call. “Improved supply and availability in Q1” helped Blackwell take off and she said Nvidia expects to continue that progress in Q2. She noted GeForce has a footprint of 100 million users, and AI PC models are able to run Microsoft’s Copilot+ AI technology.And the company said Nvidia DLSS 4 is now available in over 125 games, including Black Myth Wukong, DOOM: The Dark Ages, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Marvel Rivals and Star Wars Outlaws.It also noted the Nintendo Switch 2, which is launching on June 5, is powered by an Nvidia processor and AI-powered DLSS, delivering up to 4K gaming. Nvidia said this offers a “giant leap” in gaming consoles today.And it launched the Nvidia RTX Remix modding platform, attracting over two million gamers, alongside the release of the Half-Life 2 RTX demo.Professional VisualizationThe Nvidia Omniverse is growing.First-quarter revenue was $509 million, flat with the previous quarter and up 19% from a year ago.Announced the Nvidia RTX PRO Blackwell series for workstations and servers.The company unveiled Nvidia DGX Spark and DGX Station personal AI supercomputers powered by the Nvidia Grace Blackwell platform.Nvidia announced that leading industrial software and service providers Accenture, Ansys, Databricks, SAP, Schneider Electric with ETAP, and Siemens are integrating the Nvidia Omniverse platform into their solutions to accelerate industrial digitalization with physical AI.Automotive and RoboticsNvidia Isaac GR00T makes it easier to design humanoid robots.First-quarter Automotive revenue was $567 million, down 1% from the previous quarter and up 72% from a year ago.The company announced a collaboration with General Motors on next-generation vehicles, factories and robots using Nvidia Omniverse, Nvidia Cosmos and Nvidia Drive AGX.It also announced Nvidia Isaac GR00T N1, the world’s first open humanoid robot foundation model, followed by Nvidia Isaac GR00T N1.5; Nvidia Isaac GR00T-Dreams, a blueprint for generating synthetic motion data; and Nvidia Blackwell systems to accelerate humanoid robot development.GB DailyStay in the know!

    "content": "Electronic Artsconfirmed that it has canceled its planned Black Panther game and closed the game studio making it, Cliffhanger Games.Cliffhanger Games opened in 2023 to make the Black Panther game as part of EA’s deal with Marvel for multiple games. EA is still working on an Iron Man title. A spokesperson said anIGN reporton the closing is accurate but had no further comment.IGN reported that EA executive Laura Miele said it is shutting the game and studio to “sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities.”EA also said it is laying off staff on its mobile and central teams, but it didn’t say how many were affected. In April, EA laid off a few hundred people with the cancellation of a Titanfall game.“These decisions are hard,” Miele said in a memo to staff. “They affect people we’ve worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We’re doing everything we can to support them– including finding opportunities within EA, where we’ve had success helping people land in new roles.”EA has been in an uncertain time, with new triple-A games failing to get traction and the result being a new conservatism among game executives, who are not greenlighting as many new intellectual properties. In this case, Black Panther was a well-known franchise with a spectacular movie background, butCliffhanger was led by Kevin Stephens, who oversaw the production of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Middle-earth: Shadow of War at Monolith Productions. He joined EA in 2021.Miele said that EA would focus on Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and Apex Legends, Iron Man and the next Star Wars: Jedi title. EA is working on various mobile games, BioWare’s Mass Effect, and a number of EA Sports titles.GB DailyStay in the know!

    "content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage.Learn MoreResearchers from Meta’sFAIR teamandThe Hebrew University of Jerusalemhave discovered that forcing large language models to “think” less actually improves their performance on complex reasoning tasks.Thestudyreleased today found that shorter reasoning processes in AI systems lead to more accurate results while significantly reducing computational costs.“In this work, we challenge the assumption that long thinking chains results in better reasoning capabilities,” write the authors in their paper titled “Don’t Overthink it. Preferring Shorter Thinking Chains for Improved LLM Reasoning.”The research contradicts the prevailing trend in AI development, where companies have invested heavily in scaling up computing resources to allow models to perform extensive reasoning through lengthy “thinking chains” — detailed step-by-step trajectories that AI systems use to solve complex problems.AI accuracy jumps 34% when models use shorter reasoning chainsThe researchers discovered that within the same reasoning task, “shorter reasoning chains are significantly more likely to yield correct answers — up to 34.5% more accurate than the longest chain sampled for the same question.” This finding held true across multiple leading AI models and benchmarks.“While demonstrating impressive results, [extensive reasoning] incurs significant computational costs and inference time,” the authors note, pointing to a substantial inefficiency in how these systems are currently deployed.Based on these findings, the team developed a novel approach called “short-m@k,” which executes multiple reasoning attempts in parallel but halts computation once the first few processes complete. The final answer is then selected through majority voting among these shorter chains.New ‘short-m@k’ method slashes computing costs by 40% while boosting performanceFor organizations deploying large AI reasoning systems, the implications could be substantial. The researchers found their method could reduce computational resources by up to 40% while maintaining the same level of performance as standard approaches.“Short-3@k, while slightly less efficient than short-1@k, consistently surpasses majority voting across all compute budgets, while still being substantially faster (up to 33% wall time reduction),” the paper states.Michael Hassid, the paper’s lead author, and his team also discovered that training AI models on shorter reasoning examples improved their performance — challenging another fundamental assumption in AI development.“Training on the shorter ones leads to better performance,” the researchers write. “Conversely, finetuning on S1-long increases reasoning time with no significant performance gains.”Tech giants could save millions by implementing “don’t overthink it” approachThe findings come at a critical time for the AI industry, as companies race to deploy increasingly powerful models that consume enormous computational resources.“Our findings suggest rethinking current methods of test-time compute in reasoning LLMs, emphasizing that longer ‘thinking’ does not necessarily translate to improved performance and can, counter-intuitively, lead to degraded results,” the researchers conclude.‘This research stands in contrast to other prominent approaches. Previous influential studies, including OpenAI’s work on“chain-of-thought” promptingand “self-consistency” methods, have generally advocated for more extensive reasoning processes. It also builds upon recent work like Princeton and Google DeepMind’s “Tree of Thoughts” framework and Carnegie Mellon’s “Self-Refine” methodology, which have explored different approaches to AI reasoning.For technical decision makers evaluating AI investments, the research suggests that bigger and more computationally intensive isn’t always better. The study points toward potential cost savings and performance improvements by optimizing for efficiency rather than raw computing power.In an industry obsessed with scaling up, it turns out that teaching AI to be more concise doesn’t just save computing power — it makes the machines smarter too. Sometimes, even artificial intelligence benefits from the age-old wisdom: don’t overthink it.Daily insights on business use cases with VB DailyIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

    "content": "How would you like to earn money while watching TV?Rumi, an AI media company, has raised $4.7 million in a pre-seed funding round to transform passive media with rewards.Rumi is launching its invite-only beta app today and it aims to allows users to engage with media content in real time.The round, co-led by A16z crypto CSX and EV3, will support Rumi’s mission to build the first decentralized AI infrastructure for media, combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with user-powered indexing to transform streaming into an intelligent, interactive experience.Viewers can chat with characters or pro sports athletes about what they’re doing on the screen, identify actors and outfits on screen, or receive real-time fact checks during heated political debates — all powered by AI.“Rumi sits at the cutting edge of AI agents, consumer media and decentralized infrastructure,” said Salvador Gala, cofounder of EV3, in a statement. “Their approach to indexing audio and video content through a distributed network of AI-powered nodes empowers users to directly benefit from existing behaviors.”Streaming meets earningRumi has raised $4.7 million.With users spending more than five hours a day watching content — often while multitasking — Rumi allows them to earn passive income by contributing spare compute to build the world’s richest knowledge base on video content that in turn allows AI agents to deeply understand and augment media in ways we can’t even imagine yet, the company said.“AI can make storytelling truly immersive — but it first needs to understand the world’s content and culture to do so,” said Niko Cunningham, CEO of Rumi, in a statement. “Rumi is building that infrastructure and giving users a way to be part of it from day one.”This decentralized indexing system helps AI agents deliver smarter insights and personalized features such as contextual overlays, real-time cultural context and interactive recommendations, while protecting user privacy and respecting content IP.Business model and partnershipsRumi is licensing infrastructure to third party AI agents, developers, and creators, providing agents brand new functionality and monetization opportunities. Those opportunities include contextual ads which, from the viewer’s perspective, can be seamlessly integrated in the conversation with AI agents, and much more value-adding. Agents can organically surface recipe cards during cooking shows or fashion links tied to what characters are wearing on the screen.Rumi is also building a “decentralized Nielsen,” offering real-time analytics and audience insights. Early partnerships includeVirtuals.io, who will integrate Rumi’s APIs to provide agents using their platform media contextual-awareness and interactivity capabilities, in addition to TVision and Story Protocol who will rely on Rumi to provide unique viewership data and content analytics.Rumi is now welcoming early users to its watch-to-earn beta, allowing participants to help build what it calls the first intelligent, user-powered media ecosystem. Sign up athttps://www.rumilabs.io.How Rumi worksInfrastructure allowing AI to understand human stories and culture locked in billions of hours of video.Imagine having an entire cast and crew, commentators, shopping assistants, fact-checkers, researchers, and writers in your living room — sitting on your couch with you as you watch your favorite movies, shows, sports, news. That’s media contextually-aware AI. To enable that future, the company built a decentralized network of indexers analyzing content as they watch, and getting compensated for their work and compute.Over time, the company plans to use the money to bring to market the world’s best AI architecture for distilling the story from video: relations between actions, characters, objects; story / character arcs — mapping, understanding and AI participating in the world’s stories — not just documents and facts like today’s current LLMs.The company is building infrastructure to support Live TV / sports (vs historical content that are covering now) and to build a brand-new gateway to media, D2C app — first ever AI remote and media companion.How the “watch-to-earn” model worksRumi indexes videos and offers rewards to viewers.Users get paid for their compute and data contributions. They are providing value by analyzing video content and interacting with it on their machines.That data is valuable because it empowers the next generation of AI agents that can identify and deeply understand content, providing them the ability to augment and personalize content for you, and turn passive media into interactive experience.The viewership analytics data that we’re collecting on how people interact with content at the depth never reached before, is also used to improve content and advertising quality.The company said it will help individual creators and Hollywood studios improve quality of storytelling, as Rumi is collecting the richest and most granular trove of data on what resonates with people — stories, characters, objects.Rumi said it will boost advertisers’ return-on-investment by enabling contextual, agentic ads, that are more personalized and valuable to consumer, and feel seamless, organic — embedded in the natural conversation flow… ads that don’t feel like ads. Of course, people have to agree to the privacy policies of the company.As far as the target audience goes, Rumi said anyone with a computer and access to streaming platforms can join our network today and get rewarded for their contributions to enabling the AI-powered Media future. The company is primarily focused on Web3 users, as they’re used to the model of sharing their spare resources, such as compute power or bandwidth, in exchange for points or tokens.Rival companiesThere are a few decentralized networks paying people for their compute resources to train AI models or run inference, such as Bittensor, Akash, or Render.However, Rumi said it is focused on video understanding and have built its proprietary deep learning models and architectures that allow it to distill the essence of the story from the video, which Rumi believes will be critical for AI to truly understand the stories humans care about and how they connect to our culture, building up towards more human AI.Rumi makes money by providing media contextual awareness to AI Agents, allowing them to become way more than simple bots on social media. Rumi charges them for accessing its APIs and serve their end users contextual Ads.It’s also selling viewership data and analytics to media companies, advertisers, AI Labs, and other parties interested in understanding how consumers interact with content (on which they spend perhaps five hours a day).Content licensing and rights management policies for AIRumi said it is never storing, rebroadcasting nor exposing any actual IP-protected content. Its decentralized network is indexing it in similar fashion that Google indexed web pages.The company said it will never train any AI models on that IP-protected content. It is building infrastructure that benefits IP owners: Rumi gives them a brand new direct channel of communication with their audiences, via which they can deepen the consumer engagement in ways unimaginable before, and access new monetization opportunities.Courts have repeatedly upheld that publishing granular transcriptions or summaries of video content qualify as fair use—as seen in Google Books (Authors Guild v. Google), where digitizing and displaying searchable snippets of entire books was ruled transformative. And the same held in TVEyes v. Fox, where indexing and repurposing broadcast content for search and review was partially upheld as fair use.Rumi’s network of indexers transcribes content, but it doesn’t publish it to the public. Rumi’s protocol only exposes APIs to allow AI Agents to interact with that transcript and content fingerprint, prompt by prompt.Rumi said this opens endless opportunities for creators to make their content more personalized and interactive, so it ultimately benefits the IP owners, as they direct channels of communication with their audiences, which they can monetize.Why now? What macro trends are converging that make Rumi viable today?Consumers want more interactive, connected, personalized and immersive entertainment. It’s clear looking at the growth of gaming, social media, and the massive second screening trend: 80% of Gen Zs report constantly scrolling through their phones while watching TV.Consumer AI agents are about to boom, but they will not start with high stakes use cases like planning and paying for your vacation. They will start in your living room, making your entertainment more immersive, connected and educational. Tech is finally ready, and anyone can analyze content on their device, contribute to more immersive and personalized future of media, and earn while doing that, Rumi said.GB DailyStay in the know!

    "content": "Adam Kugler had a good career making triple-A games for Blizzard Entertainment, working in a 12-year stint of art and design jobs that culminated in a job as associate game director.But then he left the company to pursue his own dream: a deeply personal journey of making a game by himself as founder ofCyan Avatar Studios. And now he is unveilingMoteMancer, a fantasy puzzle game where alchemy meets logistics. The PC game is in alpha testing and is available forwishlisting on Steam. Thedemo is livenow.MoteMancer is a beautiful game, envisioned and produced by Kugler, who left the dream job at a triple-A game company to pursue his passion. The players job is to automate a sustainable natural ecosystem across six elemental planes using magical structures on an alien planet. It’s about restoring life. Kugler spoke about his shift from triple-A to solo dev in a roundtable at ourGamesBeat Summit 2025event.A mote of dustAdam Kugler is the founder of CyanAvatar Studios.The title itself channels Carl Sagan, the creator of Cosmos. Sagan had a famous quote about the earth being a “pale blue dot,” and that the planet was like a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.The players has to use alchemical ingredients and spells to create elegant systems on a 2D hex grid. The six planes are kind of like six different planets, but they’re all co-located as alternate dimensions in the same space. You can swap between the planes in real time.“I was always really inspired by indie games along the way because you have the food that feeds you as you’re as you’re creating things,” Kugler said. “And so this is my step into indie as my love letter to the space that inspired me so much.”Players solve logistics puzzles on a hex grid where beauty, elegance, and efficiency naturally occur. Players have to discover spells, aspects, and magical structures through alchemical experimentation. And they have to defend their natural network against Entropy, a creeping adversary that disrupts your designs. The goal is to restore the game’s main portal.MoteMancer has magical systems working together.“I come from a system design background, and so one of the things I wanted to provide was every single plane has its own set of tools,” Kugler said. “I really like sandbox games, where players have their own tools and their own way to solve the problems that they create for themselves. Like Minecraft, Factorio and Dyson Sphere Program.”The genre bears no resemblance to the work that Kugler did at Blizzard, which included the World of Warcraft massively multiplayer online role-playing game, which had a big development team.As you can tell from a quick look at the trailer, MoteMancer is a beautiful game that looks like it was built by a much bigger team. Kugler self-funded the game and built it himself, with some help from friendly developers. Kugler wants to show it at theSteam Next Fest and Automation Festin July.The solo lifeMoteMancer is part of a solo dev trend among indies.Kugler isn’t alone in turning his back on triple-A and going the solo route. Some popular indie hit games made mostly by one person include Billy Basso’s Animal Well (a big hit in 2024 that was made over seven years); Balatro, which was made by the anonymous developer LocalThunk; George Fan’s Octogeddon (made by two people); Potions, made over a decade by Renee Gittins and a small team.Motoviti had a couple of devs and a small team who worked onElroy and the Aliensfor 11 years. And Stardew Valley, which sold more than 41 million copies, was made by Eric Barone. Jonathan Blow is also well known for making games as a solo dev on titles like Braid and The Witness.Of course, as with many hit solo games, Kugler is getting a lot of help. There are categories where he tapped freelance contributors for help. But the vision was his. He thinks of it as a “love letter to the genre” of fantasy automation, which moves away from more traditional industrial complex games.MoteMancer is about sustainability in a magical nature.One friend is helping optimize the game. An artist helped do concept work. But Kugler did about 80% of the game and probably 95% of the coding.Alexandria Makova composed music for the game under a contract. The music gets more intense when you have to deal with problems like meteors, tornadoes and other disasters.“It’s not necessarily about making the largest factory possible. It’s more about the logistics puzzles,” he said.Game mechanics and Elemental interactionMoteMancer has a complicated research tree.The game allows players to visit different planes, each with its own set of elements and tools, creating a dynamic and interconnected world. The planes create challenges, where you can’t place certain buildings in some of the planes. And the constant enemy is entropy — the notion that natural forces tend toward disorder — which saps energy from the player’s bases.In one level, you use solar leaves to soak up energy from the sun, but you can’t do that in the shadow plane. The research tree includes air, water, life, earth, fire and shadow. Each one has a different kind of power to fuel the creations.“There’s an enemy in the game, but it’s much more of a relaxed enemy, as it is entropy,” he said.There are super powerful combinations of elements. Life and water, for example, can grow coral, which is just a slow growth process. If you’re playing earth and fire, there are self-powered rivers that will move items without needing to use power. Shadow and fire have a combination that lets you do wireless power so you can broadcast it across very disparate areas.“What I’m hoping is for players can find the super powerful pieces that speak to them the most and then choose them as their main base of operations,” he said.Finding the timeAn icy plane in MoteMancer.Kugler spent about 2.5 years developing the game, starting first as a side project while he was at Blizzard Entertainment. Blizzard had an official program for side projects.“I love automation and probably have thousands of hours in automation games at this point, across many different games,” he said.Kugler was trained as an artist, and he used the Unity game engine to make the game. He had to learn coding in order to do the project. He used ChatGPT to brainstorm and he used Trello for tracking tasks.Ultimately, Kugler has a passion for inspiring the next generation of creators to make their own dream games. The game also has a message about ecological sustainability, whereas many of the games in the automation space involved giant industrial complexes that pillage the environment. Kugler is starting to engage with creators who can help publicize the game.One of the easy things about going solo is that he didn’t have to create a design document so that he could explain the game to a 300-person team. When someone came in to help, he would have to talk to them for a while.“Ever since working in triple-A, I’ve been super inspired by especially the one to five person teams,” he said. “A lot of times I wake up and feel like, ‘Here’s what the game needs done today.'”MoteMancer has a vivid blend of colors.He admires games like Valheim, Return of the Obra Din and more.“Used sparingly, I think that AI tools are super powerful, but I think they’re more of a workflow helper, rather than like a means to an end,” Kugler said.As for the eco-friendly theme, Kugler said, “There are games that are about revitalizing things. This is very much leaning in that direction, for sure. So I’m not going to go out of my way to call out that you’re an eco fighter. But the game will kind of speak that language itself, I think. That’s what I’m hoping for. It’s just the message of healing lands, assembling something from from things. I think that’s a very human thing to just kind of be a creator.”GB DailyStay in the know!

    "content": "Akool Live Camerauses AI to capture human movement and mimic that movement with a generated virtual avatar in real time.Akoolcan also translate speech in real time during a virtual meeting and also provide instant face swapping during a call. The AI technology listens to conversations in one language and instantly translates them into the selected target language, providing real-time, synchronized audio that matches the avatar’s lip movements and facial expressions.This video generation technology owes its smarts to AI from Akool, a startup based in Palo Alto, California, said Jiajun “Jeff” Lu, CEO of Akool, in an interview with GamesBeat.“Our main motivation is to enhance the real-time experience and live experiences. For example, you can use avatars to join meetings, you can use video translation to do real-time meeting translations, and lots of other things,” Lu said. “We want to make it so you can’t tell the avatar from the real person.”The company also offers lip-syncing for avatars in real time, where the avatar lip movements can match the words being spoken by a person in real time, Lu said.This Akool Live Camera tool is a part of the Akool Live Suite, a first-of-its-kind collection of products that features live, real-time video generation with minimal delay. The suite includes live avatars, live face swap, video translation, and real-time video generation.“The products we offer are live AI avatars, video translation, face swap and image to video generation, and so on,” Lu said. “We definitely are very competitive in the landscape in terms of human centered videos and things that we do are now available to be in real time.”It delivers the kind of hyper-realistic visuals you’d expect from OpenAI’s video generation model Sora, but created instantly and in real time, Lu said.The implications of Akool Live Camera are pretty powerful. For the first time, a sales rep can present in perfect, lip-synced Spanish while speaking only English. A CEO can address global teams as a hyper-realistic digital avatar. A Twitch streamer can broadcast as an anime character without expensive motion-capture gear. And it all happens live in sub-100-millisecond latency across platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet.“Akool Live Camera sets a new standard in AI-powered video generation technology, going well beyond scripted, text-based prompts,” said Lu. “This opens up a new array of possibilities for virtual meetings and live streams, especially when connecting with international audiences.”A new paradigm for live AI-powered video generationJiajun “Jeff” Lu is CEO of Akool.Akool Live Camera isn’t merely another video generator. It’s an interactive engine that simulateshuman presence dynamically, analyzing live audio/visual inputs to generate responsive avatars withexpressions and contextual awareness.Akool Live Camera thrives in unscripted environments where minimal latency makes synthetic humans indistinguishable from reality, such as live streams, virtual meetings, and augmented reality gaming. At least that’s the goal, said Lu.The breakthrough lies in the technology’s ability to synthesize human interactions without preprocessing. Akool Live Camera’s edge-computing architecture processes live feeds instantaneously, allowing the avatars to adjust emotion, gestures, and speech cadence based on real-time audience analytics—a feat akin to an AI director improvising a film during live production.Key features of Akool Live Camera, all in real-time include:● AI Avatars: Seamless, photorealistic avatars that mirror a speaker’s expressions, gestures, and tone—reacting dynamically to audience cues in real time.● Video Translation: Instantly translates spoken language while preserving voice identity and syncing lip movements—enabling lifelike, multilingual communication during live events.● Live Face Swap: Swaps faces in real time with precision and emotion retention, allowing speakers to represent different identities while maintaining authentic performance. The company worked on applications with Coca-Cola and Qatar Airways.● AI Video Generation: Creates unscripted, hyper-realistic video on the fly—no pre-recording, scripting, or post-production needed. Content is generated live, based on context, tone, and audience interaction.Key capabilities of Akool Live Camera include:● Unmatched live interaction: Live face swap, avatar streaming and multilingual translation during calls/streams outpace other pre-recorded solutions.● Real-time multilingual translation: Break language barriers with synchronized voice translations that maintain the nuances of your original speech.● Dynamic expression and gesture mapping: Ensure your avatar reflects your real-time emotions and movements for authentic engagement.● Cross-platform versatility: Smooth and easy integration with Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet and more.● Privacy-forward design: Professional avatars protect user identities in sensitive meetings, with local facial data processing for added security.● Market- and audience-specific customization: Leverage anime, retro or business-centric avatars with robust outfit/persona swapping.Lu said Akool Live Camera fundamentally changes the future of live video creation — no longer is it limited to just providing text prompts. The combination of Akool’s AI and intuitive design empowers creators, educators and enterprises to connect more authentically and efficiently than ever.Slated for general availability in late 2025, Akool Live Camera is set to transform global communication through real-time, AI-powered interactions. Currently in beta and available to a select group of early adopters, the platform offers an exclusive glimpse into the future of live video.You can secure your early access today at akool.com/live-camera and be among the first to experience the next era of live AI video generation. Secure your early access today by visiting https://akool.com/live-camera.OriginsFounded in 2022, Akool has grown rapidly and invoiced tens of millions of dollars. Its product lineup includes video translation, real-time streaming avatars, studio-quality face swap, talking avatars, and the newly launched Akool Live Suite—a first-of-its-kind collection of real-time tools enabling live avatars, live face swap, and dynamic video generation with minimal delay.Unlike Sora, which crafts narratives from text prompts, Akool Live Camera thrives in unscripted environments such as live streams, virtual meetings, and AR gaming. The goal is to take advantage of low latency to make synthetic humans created by Akool become indistinguishable from reality, Lu said.The company has about 80 people now, with team members who used to work at Apple and Google. Lu himself worked at Google Cloud with a focus on cloud video processing. He also worked at Apple on Face ID. While the headquarters is in Palo Alto, Lu said the team is spread out.He said the team hasn’t raised much money and is instead generating revenue from AI avatars, face swapping and video translation. Lu said the company can do a wide variety of languages in terms of real-time translation.“Definitely AI video is moving at a faster pace of change. We are following that pace. In the long run, I believe that having a good user community will be pretty important in the coming years,” he said. “I predict the tech will get mature pretty quickly.”As a small company, he said the focus is on developing models that are better for the tasks that we people care about.“We are very ahead in this live game. Definitely, we have very strong engineers [who] are optimizing all the AI to make them run faster. We also have very strong engineers to optimize the whole pipeline to make them work well and have good experiences,” Lu said. “And we build our models from scratch ourselves. From model design to data collection to the whole pipeline, rather than leveraging some open source stuff.”He said the company checks for copyrights when training models in order to avoid using IP for which it doesn’t have rights.I asked what Lu thinks about the worries have about AI. He noted AI is getting “high attention” and his goal is to make AI work properly. The company puts watermarks into AI-generated content so it can’t be mistaken for being AI or human. The company also has content moderation tools.GB DailyStay in the know! Get the latest news in your inbox dailySubscribeRead ourPrivacy PolicyThanks for subscribing.

    "content": "Oncade, a new community-driven platform built to increase studio revenue through strengthening player engagement, raised $4 million.Oncade is revamping the game distribution model by shifting from the traditional one-sided platform struggle to a direct-to-consumer, off-platform game store powered by community engagement.By bypassing the “crushing 30% platform fees” charged by platform owners, Oncade said it gives studios the power to reclaim control over their margins and transform their communities into powerful sales channels that drive pre-sales, wishlist growth, and revenue. The company is targeting PC and mobile platforms.“In gaming, the value distribution is broken. The people driving value – studios, players, creators, and communities – aren’t earning their proper share of the financial rewards,” said Stavros Lee, founder of Oncade, in a statement. “We’re here to change that.”A16z CSX led the round, with participation from visionary founders and a network of industry leaders.Why Oncade Is differentOncade believes gaming’s business model is broken.The video game industry is broken. Studios leave vital revenue on the table by not activating the communities already advocating for their games. Traditional discovery methods are failing, such as paid ads, algorithmic feeds, and influencer marketing.Acquisition costs have soared, platforms demand high fees, yet throttle your reach, and the endless demand for fresh content drains resources without growing player bases.Oncade’s easy-to-use solution helps studios increase revenue and mobilize their communities through a more efficient, aligned, and scalable path to success. It simplifies the creation and sale of new items players want at significantly lower fees than traditional app stores through their unique off-platform game store approach.Backed by a stablecoin protocol, the platform enables developers and players to create, sell, and earn as affiliates, fostering a thriving, participatory ecosystem.Oncade offers developers:•Advanced Payments: Say goodbye to delayed payments and 30% platform fees, as Oncade uses modern payment rails and stablecoins to deliver real-time revenue.•Direct-to-Consumer Game Stores: Launch your branded storefront, bypassing the high platform fees, and keep more of your earnings. Reach players directly through trusted community-driven channels.•Community-Powered Presales & Wishlists Growth: Turn your community into a sales engine. Drive early interest, boost wishlists, and generate revenue.•LiveOps Tools for Player Engagement: Keep your players engaged with real-time updates, events, and rewards, all easily managed through Oncade’s integrated LiveOps suite.•Instant Global Payments: Reward your players instantly with stablecoin-powered payouts, creating a seamless and engaging experience across borders.Developers offer communities:• Community-Led Distribution: Players can become affiliates, earning directly for every sale they drive—no middlemen, no gatekeepers.• Creator Economies for All: Players can create and sell in-game items, cosmetics, and more, unlocking new revenue streams and deeper engagement.Why now?Stavros Lee is cofounder of Oncade.Two seismic shifts make Oncade’s vision inevitable:•Global Payments Revolution: Stablecoins and instant payment infrastructure now allow players worldwide to be rewarded instantly, breaking down historic barriers.•Proven Power of Player Economies: Games like CS:GO, Roblox, and Fortnite have demonstrated unmistakably that when players create and earn, they stick around. This powerful model was previously reserved for industry giants, but Oncade makes it accessible to every studio.OriginsGreg Reisdorf is cofounder of Oncade.Oncade’s founding team brings over 35 years of experience across triple-A studios, live service games, and creator platforms. With new backing, the company is poised to reshape how games grow, scale, and thrive.Stavros Lee worked at Electronic Arts, Activision and Ouya (where he was head of engineering). He was mobile director at Razer, and he shipped software to billions at Meta and Coinbase.Greg Reisdorf has 13 years leading multiplayer on Call of Duty, stewarding $10 B+ in lifetime gaming revenue. They started the company in San Francisco this year and they have six employees.“We’re not just building a platform—we’re building a movement,” said the founders, in a statement. “The next era of gaming belongs to empowered communities and collaborative studios.”Oncade said it is shopify for games. It has a suite of tools that allows game studios and affiliates to sell games and game items directly to players. The affiliates can be anyone. They sign-in, copy the affiliate link to any item and get paid. Affiliates earn a percentage of the sale. Studios can offer a 20% affiliate rate and still make more money than the traditional 30% platform fees.Affiliates are able to create their own storefronts highlighting their favorite games and items for their communities. Affiliate stores create a powerful ecosystem for sales and marketing while studios and the affiliates continue to earn.The marketplace and community content tools allow studios to easily set up, run and earn with their community. These increase engagement for game communities without the need for constant content creation. Previously this was only possible for large studios who could afford dedicated finance departments. Oncade creates the foundation for player economies in every game, and it takes 2.5% plus the cost of the channel.They compete with bigger payments companies with new tech where they offer easy affiliate payments bringing the community into distribution for games. By not having payout thresholds, the company can provide immediate rewards to the community that helps grow the games they love.GB DailyStay in the know!

    "content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage.Learn MoreVibe codingis arguably one of the hottest trends in tech right now, as it reflects a wider adoption of AI and natural language prompts for basic code completion (challenging the conventional coding mindset that humans should complete downstream tasks).Googleisreleasing Stitch, a new experiment from Google Labs, to compete with Microsoft, AWS, and other existing end-to-end coding tools. Now in beta, the platform designs user interfaces (UIs) with one prompt—and some developersare already gushing.“Google dropped the most powerful UI designer in the world,” Brendan Jowett, owner of voice AI company Inflate AI,posted on X.A spate of vibe coding toolsThe use of AI in programming and development certainly isn’t new, but the concept of “vibe coding” — coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy earlier this year — is a newer concept incorporating generative AI to automate coding tasks typically done manually. This goes beyond existing AI assistants and drag-and-drop no-code and low-code tools: The focus is on the end result, not the journey there.“You finally give into the vibes, embrace exponentials and forget that code even exists,” Karpathywrote on X.Top players in the integrated development environment (IDE) space include Windsurf (formerly Codeium), Cursor, Replit, Lovable, Bolt, Devin and Aider. Anthropic also recently launched its command-line AI agentClaude Code.Larger players in addition to Google are looking to stake their claim, as well: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is offering its Amazon Q Developer AI assistant as anadd-on for developersto access directly at any point in their coding; Microsoft released GitHub Copilotagent mode; OpenAI is looking to extend its capabilities in vibe coding with its Codex update andintended $3 billion purchaseof Windsurf; and Agentforce is writing about20% of Salesforce’s code.Google, for its part, also recently released autonomous coding agentJules into beta.Stitch builds UIs with a promptWith Google Stitch, users can designate whether they want to build a dashboard or web or mobile app and describe what it should look like (such as color palettes or the user experience they’re going for).The platform instantly generates HTML, CSS+ and templates with editable components that devs and non-devs can customize and edit (such as instructing Stitch to add a search function to the home screen). They can then add directly to apps or export to Figma.“Design is an iterative process, and Stitch facilitates this by allowing you to generate multiple variants of your interface,” Google Labs researchers explain. “Experiment with different layouts, components and styles to achieve the desired look and feel.”Users can choose a ‘standard mode’ that runs on Gemini 2.5 Flash or switch to an ‘experimental mode’ that uses Gemini Pro and allows users to upload visual elements such as screenshots, wireframes and sketches to guide what the platform generates.Google also plans to release a feature allowing users to annotate screenshots to make changes.Stitch is “meant for quick first drafts, wireframes and MVP-ready frontends,” Jowett notes in his X thread.Some say layouts are ‘unreal’; others call Bolt superiorMany users have offered early praise.One noted: “I tried Stitch with a ‘crypto wallet dashboard’ prompt and it nailed the layout in under 10 seconds. Unreal.”X user “God of Prompt”posted: “Honestly shocked this isn’t getting more attention. A real UI generator backed by Gemini with Figma export? Instant use-case.”However, others found the beta version less than optimal. Elizabeth Alli of DesignerUp outlined her experiences in ablog post: The dev prompted Stitch to make an app to help build mindfulness habits. She reported that it “missed the mark” on design elements (such as the colors she was looking for) and she wasn’t able to click around, as the platform only generated one screen (and in subsequent prompts she had difficulty generating the next logical screen or any other screen).Also, there aren’t many editing options to choose from, and when Alli uploaded an image from a website she designed, she was not impressed by the formatting, typography, color combinations and “dated” shadows and icons.“I had much higher expectations from Google given that there are already so many existing AI to UI design generation tools on the market that do this much better,” she writes. “Their effort seems half-baked at best.”While it is in beta, it doesn’t have “anywhere near” the polished output of other offerings such as Figma’s First Draft or Uizard’s Autodesigner. “This release seems like a bit of a mad dash to throw their hat into the ring of the AI UI design hype,” Alli notes.Other early users agree that Stitch can be wonky and underwhelming, that the designs aren’t quite there yet, and that other existing tools are still superior.One X user lamented: “I used the same prompt that I used to generate landing pages in other AI tools which return direct code, but the designs were so much better in the other tools such as Bolt.”It’s clear Google has some kinks to work out if it intends to compete with already entrenched players. Still, it’s early in the vibe coding game, and users are eager to experiment with a variety of tools, so it’ll be interesting to see Stitch’s next iteration.Try Stitch out for yourselfhere.Daily insights on business use cases with VB DailyIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

    "content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage.Learn MoreSpotthas raised $3.2 million in seed funding to build an AI-native platform that promises to transform how recruitment agencies operate. The San Francisco-based startup announced the funding round today, led byBase10 Partnerswith participation fromY Combinator,Fortino,True Equityand several angel investors. The capital injection follows Spott’s recent completion of Y Combinator’sWinter 2025 accelerator program.“For too long, recruitment firms have relied on outdated software to manage daily operations,” said Lander Degreve, co-founder and CEO at Spott, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “Spott solves the problem of outdated, passive, and fragmented recruitment software by offering an all-in-one AI-native platform that actively automates entire workflows, enabling recruiters to focus on what matters most and make more placements.”The recruitment technology space has seen a flood of point solutions in recent years, especially since generative AI tools began proliferating in 2022. However, most of these tools address single pain points rather than reimagining the entire recruitment workflow.How Spott’s all-in-one AI platform challenges recruitment tech fragmentationUnlike narrowly-focused AI tools that create more tech fragmentation, Spott is building a comprehensive operating system that manages everything from candidate sourcing and screening to placement. The platform already claims to have generated over 1,000 candidate reports for its customers, which includeStanton Chase, a global executive search firm.“Existing recruitment software is largely a passive system of record, often requiring multiple integrations just to take notes, search & match candidates, run outbound campaigns or reformat CVs,” said Degreve. “As AI enters the space, the number of disconnected point solutions is only increasing. Spott brings all these capabilities, including cutting-edge AI, together in one end-to-end recruitment platform by default.”The company’s approach addresses a pain point many recruitment firms face: the necessity to cobble together multiple systems to handle different aspects of their workflow — separate tools for candidate tracking, client management, email automation, resume parsing, and formatting.This technical integration challenge represents a significant market opportunity. As recruitment agencies increasingly adopt AI tools, the pain of managing disconnected solutions grows more acute. Spott’s integrated approach could potentially capture significant market share if it successfully delivers on its promise of seamless workflow automation.“We’ve been using the report writer a lot, and the results are already very good thanks to the way the system handles the data,” Degreve cited from customer feedback. “It’s also helpful that we can review the output and make small changes with AI ourselves and instantly see how that improves the results.”From McKinsey to startup: The strategic vision behind Spott’s AI platformThe founders’ background brings a unique perspective to the recruitment technology space. Degreve and his co-founder Manu Vanderveeren previously worked at elite consulting firmsMcKinsey,BCGandBain, where they gained strategic insight into the recruitment industry’s challenges from a business perspective rather than just a technical one.“The idea for Spott emerged during our time at McKinsey and BCG, where we worked on strategy and due diligence projects for recruitment agencies focused on growth,” explained Degreve. “It became clear to us that AI would be the key growth driver and differentiator in the industry. To truly unlock AI’s full potential, the entire recruitment platform needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.”This consulting background appears to have influenced Spott’s ambitious approach. Rather than creating yet another point solution, the team is pursuing what venture capitalists often call a “platform play” — a higher-risk, higher-reward strategy that aims to become the central operating system for an entire industry.“Building the system of record is much more complex than launching a single point solution. It requires greater effort to build and sell, as clients need to migrate to a new platform,” Degreve acknowledged. “However, we believe the only way to fully unlock AI’s potential in recruitment is to rebuild the entire system from the ground up.”This strategic vision may explain why investors likeBase10 PartnersandY Combinatorhave backed the company despite the crowded recruitment technology market — they’re betting on a comprehensive reimagining of the space rather than an incremental improvement.Why AI adoption in recruitment has failed to deliver on its promiseIndustry analysts have long identified the recruitment sector as ideal for AI transformation. With its heavy reliance on pattern matching, data processing and repetitive communications, many recruitment tasks align perfectly with AI’s strengths. Yet the industry has been surprisingly slow to see widespread transformation from AI technologies.The problem isn’t a lack of AI tools — it’s their fragmentation and failure to integrate deeply into recruiters’ existing workflows. Many recruiters report “tool fatigue” from juggling multiple AI solutions alongside their core applicant tracking systems. This complexity often negates the time savings these tools promise.“The most exciting AI feature in Spott is its advanced candidate and vacancy matching. By deeply understanding all your data — vacancies, AI-generated notes, emails, LinkedIn & WhatsApp messages and CVs — it can instantly surface the most relevant candidates,” Degreve said. “This boosts the value of your database and can significantly shorten time to hire, especially when combined with automated outreach.”What’s notable about Spott’s approach is that it doesn’t treat AI as an add-on feature but as the platform’s core architecture. This “AI-native” design philosophy potentially allows for deeper integration of machine learning throughout the entire recruitment process rather than just at specific touchpoints.Early customerPauwels Solutions Groupreports that the platform “automatically formats CVs and generates tailor-made presentations in our own template, which saves a lot of time and manual work.” With its 100% contract renewal rate to date, Spott appears to be delivering on its promises — though the sample size remains small at this early stage.The future of recruitment: Agentic workflows and the changing recruiter roleWith the new funding, Spott plans to accelerate development of what may be its most ambitious feature: “agentic workflows” — AI agents that can take over entire processes within the recruitment lifecycle with minimal human supervision.“Over the next 6 to 12 months, our main focus is on building intuitive agentic workflows. These AI agents will support recruiters by gradually taking over workflows like sourcing, outreach, scheduling, and presenting candidates,” Degreve explained. “Human input will be used where it matters most and will help the agents learn and improve over time.”This vision represents a significant shift in how recruitment professionals might work in the future. Rather than spending hours on administrative tasks, formatting resumes, or searching databases, recruiters could potentially focus almost exclusively on relationship-building and closing placements.“Over the next few years, Spott envisions a major shift in recruitment that will redefine the role of the recruiter,” said Degreve. “As AI automates repetitive tasks, straightforward roles will increasingly be handled fully autonomously. In more complex searches, the recruiter’s focus will shift toward building strong relationships with candidates and clients, understanding culture fit, navigating nuanced negotiations, and addressing challenges that require human judgment.”This vision aligns with broader trends in AI adoption across professional services. The most successful implementations don’t replace professionals entirely but instead elevate their work by handling routine tasks while enabling humans to focus on high-value judgment and relationship activities. For recruitment firms feeling the squeeze of tight margins and increasing competition, this proposition is particularly compelling.The true test will come as Spott scales its platform and attempts to displace entrenched competitors in an industry known for its resistance to technological change. But with fresh funding and a clear vision, Spott has positioned itself as a contender to watch in the evolving recruitment technology landscape.Daily insights on business use cases with VB DailyIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Additionally, Claude provides visual notes that capture key insights from each discussion, giving users an easy way to review and revisit important points.Seamless transitions between text and voice, plus rich media supportOne notable feature of voice mode is the ability to switch seamlessly between text and voice interactions without losing conversation context. This flexibility supports different user preferences and use cases.Beyond spoken dialogue, voice mode also handles rich media interactions. Users can discuss documents, images and complex information using voice commands while Claude maintains the conversational flow. This allows for deeper engagement with content and easier access to insights.For Pro Plan users and above, voice mode also integrates personal information sources—such as emails, calendar events and documents—alongside real-time web search results. This combination of data sources offers a more comprehensive and actionable conversational experience.Web search for allIn parallel with the voice mode rollout, Anthropic has expanded access to web search by making it available to all users on free plans. This new capability enables Claude to draw on real-time internet data, offering fresher and more accurate responses to questions about breaking news, market trends and other dynamic topics.Web search for free plans adds to Claude’s growing toolkit of integrations and knowledge resources, making it easier for users to get relevant answers and stay current.Anthropic’s broader visionAnthropic notes that voice technology isn’t new territory for the company.Beyond the speech-to-text features in Claude’s mobile apps, Anthropic also powers Amazon’s Alexa+ and Otter AI’s transcription services.These experiences inform the development of the new voice mode and its potential to integrate with other parts of the user’s digital life.These updates join a broader suite of enhancements to Claude, including the launch of Claude 4, integrations with Google Workspace, and expanded research capabilities.A push toward more versatile user interactivityAnthropic highlighted the ease with which users can start a voice conversation and ask Claude to summarize calendar entries or search for documents—demonstrating the platform’s expanded capabilities.Anthropic has also shared media assets to provide additional resources for users interested in learning more about the updates.With the rollout of voice mode in beta and web search now included for free plans, Anthropic continues to broaden the functionality and accessibility of Claude’s AI services. These updates represent another step forward in making conversational AI more adaptable and relevant to users’ daily tasks.Daily insights on business use cases with VB DailyIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

    "content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage.Learn MoreConsulting firms’ accelerating adoption of generative AI to automate knowledge work is sending shockwaves across the industry, triggering workforce shakeups and layoffs.This month,PwCcut roughly 2% of its U.S. staff,approximately 1,500 jobs, in audit and tax lines.EYeliminated 150 roleseven as it announced a$1.4 billion investmentto build an enterprise AI platform.Accentureslashed19,000 positions(2.5% of its workforce) amid slowing growth and rising tech costs in 2023.McKinsey & Companyis reportedly paying senior staff up tonine months’ salary to quit voluntarily, a strategy industry observers link to a downturn in consulting spending accelerated by AI-driven change.KPMGis realigning skills as AI platforms replace parts of the audit process and other routine tasks. In November of last year, 333 jobs were cut, or approximately4%of U.S. audit employees.This escalating wave of AI-driven layoffs is reflected inIBM CEO Arvind Krishna’s recent acknowledgmentthat IBM has replaced several hundred routine human resources roles with AI agents. Krishna’s comments underscore the unsettling reality confronting high-performing employees: roles centered around “rote process work” are rapidly becoming obsolete. Although IBM hasreallocated some resources toward roles in software development and sales, the underlying message is clear. Employees increasingly perceive AI agents as existential threats, fueling anxiety and driving many to build shadow AI apps to preserve their relevance defensively.The bottom line is that gen AI is redefining all forms of knowledge work much faster than anyone, including the industry’s elite consultants, leaders and partners, expected.AI layoffs are sparking a survival mindsetFearing they may be caught up in sweeping layoffs driven by AI and automation, many of the industry’s elite consultants and high performers are reinventing themselves quickly before their roles vanish.Teams in the hardest hit areas often have dozens of shadow AI apps designed to improve efficiency and team productivity. Proposal and pitch automation, operations and workflow automation, financial modeling, scenario analysis, and client relationship managers being replaced by firm-specific copilots are where shadow AI flourishes. Many are relying on Python-based shadow AI to build custom automation tools, bypass internal IT bottlenecks, and deliver faster, differentiated insights that protect their roles in an industry under pressure from gen AI.Python is becoming the language of reinventionVentureBeat has learned that many of the top-tier strategists, marketers, practice leaders and their teams are becoming proficient in creating Python-based apps that can take analysis and insights beyond the existing genAI tools provided by IT. Teams creating these apps are proficient withOpen AI,Google programmable search engines,Google Gemini 2.5 Pro,Perplexityand other AI platforms’ API keys and calls. Platforms of choice for fine-tuning shadow AI apps includeGoogle ColabandGoogle AI Studio. Many are usingReplitto create standalone apps.Building Shadow AI apps with enterprise-grade reachBy combining a series of APIs and search engine IDs from Anthropic, Perplexity, Open AI and Google, the speed, accuracy and acuity of insights, associates’shadow AI apps deliver reach beyond the current scope of legitimate, IT-approved copilotsand chatbots. One SME leader confided to VentureBeat that the combination of APIs and Python fine-tuning makes it possible to create apps so hyper-customized to a client’s goals that it’s saving him days of manual work aggregating and analyzing data.Associates at top firms globally have created dozens, and in some cases hundreds, of uniqueGoogle Search Engine APIs and IDsto power their Python apps. These APIs provide precise, real-time integration of external data directly into their shadow AI tools, further boosting their analytical edge.Shadow AI is quickly emerging as the new consulting stackAn analysis by Cyberhavenof AI usage across three million employees found that73.8%of workplace ChatGPT accounts were personal rather than corporate, indicating that most consultants turn to these tools independently. Cameron Coles, VP of Marketing at Cyberhaven’s blog post last month,AI Usage at Work Is Exploding — But 71% of Tools Put Your Data at Risk, provides insights into what kind of data is most often shared across shadow AI apps and the rapid growth of the category.Coleswrites, “AI usage at work continues its remarkable growth trajectory. In the past 12 months alone, usage has increased 4.6x, and over the past 24 months, AI usage has grown an astounding 61x. This represents one of the fastest adoption rates for any workplace technology, substantially outpacing even SaaS adoption, which took years to achieve similar penetration levels.”Within top consulting firms, the proliferation of self-built, unauthorized apps continues to be explosive. Itamar Golan, CEO ofPrompt Security, notes, “We see 50 new AI apps a day, and we’ve already cataloged over 12,000,” highlighting how rapidly these shadow tools are emerging. He recently told VentureBeat during aninterviewthat “many default to indiscriminately training on proprietary data inputs,” exposing firms to substantial risk. Internal data confirms that70–75% of consultants now regularly rely on generative AI apps, directly attributing productivity gains to shadow AI apps. It’s become the weapon of choice for consulting’s top talent, enabling them to produce exceptional work in a fraction of the time.VentureBeat interviewed Golan, Vineet Arora, CTO ofWinWire, and senior leaders at fourteen leading global consultancies to understand the breadth of shadow AI adoption.:Estimating the true scale of shadow AI in consultingWhile most enterprise tools still fail to detect the scale of shadow AI use, field interviews and telemetry from Prompt Security, WinWire and interviews with 14 top-tier consulting firms make one thing clear: shadow AI is no longer a fringe phenomenon. It’s emerging as a parallel tech stack built from the ground up by consultants themselves.VentureBeat’s estimate incorporates:Prompt Security telemetry, which detects ~50 new shadow AI apps per day and has already cataloged12,000+ tools across consulting firms globally.WinWire enterprise AI data, covering Gemini, GPT-4, Claude 3 and Colab-based deployments.Cyberhaven usage data, which reveals that73.8% of ChatGPT workplace accounts are unauthorized, and enterprise AI usage has grown61x in 24 months.14 executive interviewswith CTOs, CISOs, AI leads and partners across Tier 1 firms.Only actively deployed, production-grade tools are counted, not one-off prompts, temporary Google Colab notebooks, or ChatGPT browser sessions. These numbers reflect a validated lower bound, likely far short of the true total.Shadow AI app landscape in consulting, 2025 (Verified Estimate)Use Case CategoryEstimated Shadow AI Apps (Q2 2025)Primary Tools UsedPitch & Proposal Automation12,000GPT-4, Gemini, Replit, ColabMarket Segmentation & Targeting9,000Perplexity, Gemini APIs, RAG appsResearch Assistants & Knowledge Bots15,000Claude 3, Gemini Pro, Google Search APIsClient-Facing Chatbots & Agents7,500OpenAI Assistants, LangChain, custom LLMsWorkflow & Productivity Automation13,000Python automations, Sheets, ZapierFinancial Analysis & Scenario Models18,000Monte Carlo models, Gemini + PythonTotal (Validated Estimate)74,500+Sources: Prompt Security, WinWire, Cyberhaven, VentureBeat interviews with 14 global firmsShadow AI growth trajectory: What comes nextShadow AI is scaling faster than any sanctioned internal platform, and most firms have no real way to slow it down. Based on a conservative 5% month-over-month growth rate, the number of actively used shadow apps could more than double by mid-2026.What started as isolated productivity scripts has evolved into something more durable. Shadow AI is no longer a fringe toolset. It is now a parallel delivery stack. It operates outside IT, without formal governance, yet it powers many of the high-value outputs firms deliver to clients every day.Projected shadow AI app growth in consultingQuarterProjected App CountDrivers of GrowthQ2 202574,500+Verified active apps from Prompt Security, WinWire, and interviewsQ3 202590,000 to 95,000Growth in Gemini and Claude apps, partner-led developmentQ4 2025110,000 to 115,000Shadow tools become embedded in client delivery workflowsQ1 2026130,000 to 140,000Emergence of gray-market copilots and self-maintained appsQ2 2026150,000 to 160,000+Shadow AI evolves into an ungoverned parallel delivery stackThese projections exclude one-off use of ChatGPT or Gemini in browser sessions. They reflect persistent apps and workflows built using APIs, scripting, or automated agents developed inside consulting teams.How to strategically manage shadow AI risksShadow AI is thriving because traditional IT and cybersecurity frameworks aren’t designed to track its use. IT and security teams in nearly every enterprise VentureBeat spoke with have three to five times the number of projects they can complete this year. While getting a new copilot out is a high priority, it can face resource and approval hurdles as a result.Arora underscores that “most traditional management tools lack comprehensive visibility into AI apps,” enabling unauthorized AI to quietly embed itself within enterprise workflows.” Arora’s insights reveal an underlying truth: Employees aren’t acting maliciously; they’re fearful of being let go while simultaneously overwhelmed with work, leveraging AI to cope with escalating workloads, shrinking deadlines, and relentless performance expectations.Rather than stifling AI adoption, Arora advocates proactive empowerment through strategic, centralized governance. By institutionalizing clear oversight, organizations can harness AI securely, transforming shadow AI from an unseen threat into a controlled asset.A blueprint for governanceConsultancies’ senior management teams need a clear, practical roadmap to get in front of shadow AI risks and harness its strategic potential. Arora outlined a detailed governance framework during a recent interview with VentureBeat, explicitly designed for enterprises navigating the complexities of shadow AI:Shadow AI audits are table stakes:Regularly take inventory of all unauthorized AI activity through robust network monitoring and detailed software asset management.Create an Office of Responsible AI:Centralize AI governance functions spanning policy creation, vendor assessments and risk analysis, and maintain an approved AI tools catalog accessible to all teams.Get AI-aware security controls in place immediately:Deploy specialized Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools and real-time inference monitoring capable of detecting sensitive data leaks specific to AI applications in real-time.Go all in on applying zero trust to AI architectures:Adopt strict output validation protocols, anonymize or tokenize sensitive inputs, and rigorously manage data flows to minimize exposure and prevent unauthorized data training.Find out where the roadblocks are to getting more gen AI tools out now:Every organization can improve on the speed at which it deploys new technologies. Find out where the gaps and roadblocks are holding the consultancy back from delivering more adept copilots and chatbots. It is essential to get a roadmap defined for IT and DevOps to work on for internally suggested Python apps, fine-tuned to client needs.GRC integration and continuous training:Integrate AI governance within existing governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) frameworks, and consistently consult on secure, compliant AI practices.Avoid blanket bans, it’s fuel for even more shadow AI app development:Recognize that outright AI bans inevitably backfire, increasing shadow AI proliferation. Instead, rapidly deploy secure, sanctioned alternatives that enable compliant, productive innovation.From underground tools to enterprise edgeInitially an underground productivity hack, shadow AI has emerged as a decisive factor in how top-tier consultants deliver differentiated client value. Driven by a stark survival imperative amid widespread AI-triggered layoffs, elite talent now relies on Python-driven, generative AI-powered solutions, enabling uniquely tailored client insights and rapid responses to their clients.Consulting firms that are slow to adapt or hesitant to strategically harness these innovations strategically risk forfeiting their future competitive edge. The path forward demands not prohibition but thoughtful, secure integration of shadow AI and the transformation of potential risks into decisive strategic advantages.Daily insights on business use cases with VB DailyIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

    "content": "Matthew Brombergrecently hit his one-year anniversary as Unity’s CEO. And in that time, he’s already overseen a lot of change at the popular game-engine maker.During the GamesBeat Summit 2025 event in Los Angeles, Bromberg chatted with AP tech journalist Sarah Parvini about his thoughts on the industry and what he’s been up to at Unity since joining the company inMay 2024. At that time, it’d only been a few months since the company faced amassive backlashfrom developers because of its controversial price changes (which were later walked back).So far, Bromberg has been focusing on making sure that Unity can once again be a reliable partner for developers.“Over the past year, we’ve been working really hard to, in as humble a way as possible, to really earn that trust and that position back and to continue to deliver on stable performance software that helps people innovate,” said Bromberg. “And just really focus on delivering value and making sure that our software is stable and that we reconnect with our community and our customers. We drifted away a little bit from that.”He said everyone at the company has made an effort to spend more time with the community to address their needs and see how they can add more value to them with updates to its engine tools. Part of that plan has to do with incorporating AI-powered workflows in Unity 6, which he hopes will allow developers to build games faster and more efficiently and spend more time innovating.These AI tools will be introduced in the upcomingUnity 6.2 update.“[We’re] really trying to take some best-of-breed products that are out there, gen AI products and others, and build them directly into the workflows of the Unity editor so that you can stay in context — the AI is context aware about your project,” said Bromberg. “You can stay and work inside the same windows that you’re working in, and they’re tied directly into your workflows. And we believe that is the pathway through which these tools will become more deeply adopted [by the industry].”Matthew Bromberg, CEO of Unity, at the company’s headquarters in San Francisco.Based on his 25-year career in making games, Bromberg said he feels pretty confident that in the future, the “vast majority” of game companies will use the efficiencies they gain from AI tools to make even more games.“I believe that is the primary impact that AI will have [on development],” he said. “I think if we can make games faster and more efficiently, then game companies will make more games, and they’ll have more time and cycles to spend on innovation.”In the meantime, Unity hopes to keep modernizing its game engine platform and to make sure that developers are as comfortable as possible with using it, both now and in the future. And it hopes to maintain a strong connection with its community by continually reaching out in an authentic way.A lot of Unity’s customers have been noticing these changes. In a call with one of Unity’s biggest clients (one that’s used its tools for over 15 years) last week, Bromberg said that this person told him that they felt “utterly despondent” about the company just over a year ago. But their perspective gradually changed once Unity started listening more to its developers and checking in with them.The customer said everything felt different now, and that the company is heading in a much better direction than before. Bromberg noted that when he joined Unity in 2024, “literally no one” was saying things like that to him.“It seems like an obvious, and almost silly, observation to say that if you stop to ask people what they need, and then you authentically care about it, and then you work really hard inside your company to prioritize those things, then generally it gets better, right?” said Bromberg. “[The goal isn’t] to be perfect — just try to get better at it every day, and that is how organizations move forward.”GB DailyStay in the know!

    "content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage.Learn MoreThewell-fundedand innovative French AI startupMistral AIis introducing a new service for enterprise customers and independent software developers alike.Mistral’s Agents application programming interface (API)allows third-party software developers to easily and rapidly add autonomous generative AI capabilities — such as pulling information securely from enterprise documents — to their existing enterprise and independent applications usingthe newest Mistral proprietary model, Medium 3,as the “brains” of each agent.It’s essentially designed as a “plug and play” platform with nearly limitless customization for getting AI agents up and running to handle enterprise and developer workflows.“With Agents API, we empower enterprises to use AI in more practical and impactful ways,” wroteMistral’s Head of Developer Relations, Sophia Yang, on X.Designed to complement Mistral’s existing Chat Completion API, this latest release focuses on agentic orchestration, built-in connectors, persistent memory and the flexibility to coordinate multiple AI agents to tackle complex tasks.Surpassing the limits of typical LLMs…While traditional language models excel at generating text, they often fail to execute actions or maintain conversational context over time.Mistral’s Agents API addresses these limitations by providing developers with the tools to create AI agents capable of performing real-world tasks, managing interactions across conversations and dynamically orchestrating multiple agents when needed.…with powerful tools and built-in connectorsThe Agents API comes equipped with several built-in connectors, including:Code Execution: Securely runs Python code, enabling applications in data visualization, scientific computing and other technical tasks.Image Generation: LeveragesBlack Forest Lab FLUX1.1 [pro] Ultrato create custom visuals for marketing, education or artistic uses.Document Library: Accesses documents stored in Mistral Cloud, enhancing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) features.Web Search: Allows agents to retrieve up-to-date information from online sources, news outlets and other reputable platforms.The API also supports MCP tools, which connect agents to external resources like APIs, databases, user data and documents—extending the agents’ abilities to handle dynamic, real-world content.Enhanced accuracy using web searchOne significant feature of the Agents API is the integration of web search as a connector, which notably improves performance on tasks requiring accurate, up-to-date information.In benchmark testing on the SimpleQA dataset, Mistral Large’s accuracy rose from 23% to 75% when web search was enabled. Mistral Medium showed a similar improvement, increasing from 22.08% to 82.32%.Real-world use casesMistral AI has highlighted a range of use cases for the Agents API, demonstrating its flexibility across multiple sectors:Coding Assistant with GitHub: An agent oversees a developer assistant powered by DevStral, managing tasks and automating code development workflows.Linear Tickets Assistant: Transforms call transcripts into project deliverables using a multi-server MCP architecture.Financial Analyst: Sources financial metrics and securely compiles reports through orchestrated MCP servers.Travel Assistant: Helps users plan trips, book accommodations and manage travel needs.Nutrition Assistant: Supports users in setting dietary goals, logging meals and receiving personalized recommendations.Managing context and conversationsThe Agents API’s stateful conversation system ensures that agents maintain context throughout their interactions. Developers can start or continue new conversations without losing the thread, with conversation history stored and accessible for future use.Additionally, the API supports streaming output, enabling real-time updates in response to user requests or agent actions.Dynamic orchestration of multiple agentsA core capability of the Agents API is its ability to coordinate multiple agents seamlessly. Developers can create customized workflows, assigning specific tasks to specialized agents and enabling handoffs as needed. This modular approach allows enterprises to deploy AI agents that work together to solve complex problems more effectively.What the Mistral Agents API means for enterprise technical decision-makersFor senior-level engineers working at enterprise organizations, the Mistral Agents API represents a powerful addition to their AI toolkit.The ability to dynamically orchestrate agents and seamlessly integrate real-world data sources means these roles can deploy AI solutions faster and with greater precision—critical in environments where quick iteration and performance tuning are paramount.Specifically, these professionals often balance tight deployment timelines and the need to maintain model performance across different environments.The Agents API’s built-in connectors—like web search, document libraries, and secure code execution—can significantly reduce the need for ad hoc integrations and patchwork tooling. This streamlined approach saves time and lowers friction, allowing teams to focus more on fine-tuning models and less on building surrounding infrastructure.Moreover, stateful conversation management and real-time updates through streaming output align well with AI orchestration and deployment demands. These features make it easier for engineers to maintain context across iterations and ensure consistent, high-quality interactions with end users.For those responsible for introducing and integrating new AI tools into organizational workflows, the MCP tool support also ensures that agents can access data from a wide range of APIs and systems, further enhancing operational efficiency.Continuing to bolster Mistral’s enterprise AI pushThe release of the Agents API followsMistral AI’s recent launch of Le Chat Enterprise, a unified AI assistant platform designed for enterprise productivity and data privacy. Le Chat Enterprise is poweredby the new Mistral Medium 3 model, which offers impressive performance at a lower computational cost than larger models.Mistral Medium 3 is particularly strong in software development tasks, outperforming comparable models in key coding benchmarks like HumanEval and MultiPL-E. It also shows competitive performance in multilingual and multimodal scenarios, making it an attractive option for businesses operating in diverse environments.Le Chat Enterprise supports enterprise-grade features such as data sovereignty, hybrid deployment, and strict access controls, which can be crucial for organizations in regulated sectors. The platform consolidates AI functionality within a single environment, enabling customization, seamless integration with existing workflows, and full control over deployment and data security.But it’s another proprietary serviceMistral’s earlier releases, like Mistral 7B, were open source and widely embraced by the developer community for their transparency and flexibility.However, Mistral Medium 3 is a proprietary model—requiring access through Mistral’s platform, APIs or partners—and is no longer available under an open-source license.This shift has caused some frustration in the AI community, where open access and transparency are highly valued for experimentation and customization.The Agents API itself also follows a proprietary framework: it is not available under an open-source license and is managed exclusively by Mistral, with access available via subscription and API calls.Pricing and availabilityPricing for the Agents API aligns with Mistral’s broader suite of models and tools:Mistral Medium 3: $0.4 per million input tokens and $2 per million output tokens.Web Search Connector: $30 per 1,000 calls.Code Execution: $30 per 1,000 calls.Image Generation: $100 per 1,000 images.Premium News Access: $50 per 1,000 calls.Document Library with RAG: Included in plans like Team and Enterprise, with up to 30GB per user in some tiers.Custom connectors, audit logs, SAML SSO, and other enterprise features: Available in Team and Enterprise plans (pricing typically requires contacting Mistral’s sales team).These costs can add up quickly for developers and enterprise customers, making budget considerations and careful integration planning essential.Looking aheadMistral AI positions its Agents API as the backbone of enterprise-grade agentic platforms, empowering developers to create solutions that move beyond traditional text generation.Despite the community debate around open source versus proprietary access, Mistral’s focus on enterprise-grade features, customizable workflows, and secure integrations positions this API as a significant option for businesses seeking advanced AI capabilities.For developers and technical decision makers, the question will be whether the proprietary nature of the Agents API and the underlying models aligns with their own operational and budgetary needs. For those who prioritize rapid deployment, managed services, and full integration with enterprise systems, Mistral’s evolving platform could offer significant advantages.For more information or to get started, Mistral AI encourages developers to explore the provided documentation and demos.Let me know if you’d like to expand on the open-source versus proprietary discussion even more, or if you’d like to highlight another perspective!

    "content": "IOI Partners andBuild a Rocket Boydropped a new trailer onMindsEye, a new title coming on June 10 from the co-creator of Grand Theft Auto V.The title is a cross between the gritty crime of GTAV and a future with AI robots. It also has user-generated content and post-launch live operations coming as well. MindsEye is set to release June 10 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 for $60.The news update includes details of MindsEye’s unique Game Creation Tools, which allow players to craft their own content using MindsEye assets, from custom missions to entirely new scenarios within the game’s dense world. Build a Rocket Boy also confirmed that it will continue providing updates through these same tools, extending the game’s lifespan even further.AI will be ubiquitous in Redrock.The trailer has a lot of cinematic elements that make it seem like a bold new intellectual property. But it’s also received some nitpicky comments from fans about how the shooting looks generic and the bullet spray is too wild. I wonder why the main character doesn’t take better cover when challenging a half-dozen enemies, but I am glad to see new competition for the first time in years for GTA. While many big game companies have fallen back on sequels, it’s refreshing to see a big bet on a new franchise.The drone combat in particular is futuristic and could add new elements to the combat, and it will be interesting to see where the AI narrative goes.Jacob, the lead character of MindsEye, gets help from a drone.Game director Leslie Benzies started Build a Rocket Boy after a falling out with Rockstar Games, the creator of the GTA series. He built a big team,raised a lot of moneyand partnered with publisherIOI Partners, which is part of the company behind the Hitman series.The title is a narrative-driven action-adventure thriller launching on June 10, 2025, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store.Build a Rocket Boy said the title focuses on best-in-class cinematics, dynamic gameplay, and groundbreaking integration with user-generated content through a proprietary Game Creation System that promises to keep players engaged long after the credits roll.Set in the near-futuristic city of Redrock, MindsEye delivers a tightly crafted linear story campaign. Players will step into the shoes of Jacob Diaz, a former soldier haunted by fragmented memories from his mysterious MindsEye neural implant, as he uncovers a conspiracy involving rogue AI, corporate greed, an unchecked military, and a threat so sinister that it endangers the very survival of humanity. The game’s story is brought to life with state-of-the-art visuals built on Unreal Engine 5.The menu for MindsEye can drop you in many places quickly.On the UGC front, MindsEye includes Build A Rocket Boy’s proprietary Game Creation System, empowering players to craft anything in their minds eye, in MindsEye. This deceptively easy-to-use Game Creation System has been hailed as a “novel feature for creative gamers” and is the very same system Build A Rocket Boy uses to create the continuous stream of premium content for our players. The game is set in Redrock, a fictional version of Las Vegas.Players can craft their own experiences using all of the MindsEye assets, creating everything from custom missions to entirely new scenarios within the game’s expansive, richly detailed world. Whether you’re designing a high-speed chase through Redrock’s bustling cityscapes or a stealth mission in its industrial outskirts, it is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, ensuring that players of all skill levels can bring their imagination to life. The open world part of the game reminds me of the interface for the “World of Assassination” for the Hitman game.Build A Rocket Boy will be delivering a constant stream of fresh premium content monthly, thanks to the power of the Game Creation System, ensuring MindsEye is a living, ever-expanding player experience. The studio will regularly release new missions, challenges, and game assets.The continuous stream of studio-developed content, combined with the very best of the community’s own beautiful creations, means that MindsEye will continue to surprise and delight its players for decades to come.MindsEye devs went for the realistic human look.The $60 price will be a refreshing departure for players on a budget compared to the standard $70 to $80 price tag for other big titles. MindsEye will have a Standard Edition, while the Deluxe Edition includes a Premium Pass and exclusive content like the “Exotic Pack.”“We’re beyond excited to bring MindsEye to players worldwide,” said Benzies, founder and game director at Build A Rocket Boy, in a statement. “Our team has poured their passion and dedication into creating MindsEye and the Game Creation System for almost a decade, to deliver players an unforgettable story campaign and empower them to craft their own world-class experiences.

    "content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage.Learn MoreSalesforceis making a big bid tobecome a much larger player in the enterprise space, announcing today an $8B acquisition ofInformatica. The move will bring together two large, established enterprise software providers with decades of real-worldexperience.Informatica was founded in 1993 as an enterprise data-focused vendor and an early pioneer in the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) market. As technology cycles have changed over the last 25 years, so too has Informatica, moving tocloud and SaaSand more recentlyembracing generative AI. Just last week, at the company’s Informatica World, it announced a series of new agentic AI offerings designed to help improve enterprise data management and operations.By acquiring Informatica, Salesforce aims to enhance its trusted data foundation for deploying agentic AI. The combination will create a unified architecture enabling AI agents to operate safely, responsibly and at scale across enterprises by integrating:Informatica’s rich data catalog, integration, governance, quality, privacy and Master Data Management (MDM) capabilities.Salesforce’s platform includes Data Cloud, Agentforce, Tableau, MuleSoft and Customer 360.“I’m excited to begin this new journey with Salesforce where the combination of Informatica’s rich data catalog, data integration, governance, quality and privacy, metadata management and Master Data Management (MDM) services with the Salesforce platform upon close of the transaction will establish a unified architecture for agentic AI – enabling AI agents to operate safely, responsibly and at scale, across the modern enterprise,” Amit Walia, CEO of Informatica wrote in LinkedInpost.What another big deal means for Salesforce and its enterprise customersSalesforce has been no stranger to large acquisitions.In 2021,Salesforce acquired SlackTechnologies for a staggering $28 billion. In 2019, Salesforce acquireddata analytics platform Tableaufor $16 billion. A year earlier, in 2018,Salesforce acquired MuleSoft,bolstering its enterprise software integration capabilities. All of those acquisitions have worked out well for Salesforce, with Tableau, Slackand Mulesoft growing and expanding.According to Forrester Analyst Noel Yuhanna, Salesforce’s acquisition of Informatica fills a gap in its data management capabilities.“The acquisition markedly elevates Salesforce’s position across all critical dimensions of modern data management, including data integration, ingestion, pipelines, master data management (MDM), metadata management, transformation, preparation, quality and governance in the cloud,” Yuhanna told VentureBeat. “These capabilities are no longer optional—they are foundational for building an AI-ready enterprise, especially as the industry accelerates toward agentic AI.”To fully realize AI’s promise, Yuhanna said that vendor solutions must tightly integrate data and AI as two sides of the same coin. In his view, this acquisition strengthens Salesforce’s ability to do just that, laying the groundwork for next-generation data that can power intelligent, autonomous and personalized experiences at scale to support AI use cases.“Crucially, this positions Salesforce to deliver a unified customer data fabric, enabling a truly end-to-end platform for data, AI and analytics, tailored to customer-centric use cases,” Yuhanna said. “Real-time data integration across diverse sources is becoming critical for advanced customer engagement, and this move brings Salesforce much closer to that vision.”Salesforce Informatica deal is (mostly) about agentic AIWhile data has long been the foundation of Informatica’s technology, its intersection with agentic AI makes it attractive to Salesforce.Hyoun Park, CEO and Chief Analyst atAmalgam Insights, told VentureBeat that the Informatica acquisition has been rumored for over a year, with a credible expectation last year of an $11 billion bid.“From a practical perspective, the rush towards agentic AI requires any credible player in the space to manage data, workflows, integration and models as well as the agents and to be a strong IT partner,” Park said. “The Informatica acquisition goes hand-in-hand with Salesforce’s efforts towards improving IT management capabilities and going head to head against ServiceNow and IT specialists such as Boomi in the agent space.”Park noted that there is some overlap with the MuleSoft capabilities Salesforce already has in its portfolio. That said, he emphasized that Informatica’s capabilities in data management, including master data management, data catalog and data security, are both more updated and more comprehensive.The data components that make enterprise agentic AI realData isn’t just about storing bits of content. When it comes to agentic AI it’s a whole lot more complex.“A successful agent strategy depends on the integration of three domains: models, applications and data,” Kevin Petrie, vice president of research atBARCtold VentureBeat. “Salesforce gains significant strength in the data realm, especially metadata and cataloging, through this acquisition.”Petrie noted that Salesforce is already invested in the application realm through its CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and Mulesoft offerings. Those capabilities are already being integrated into Salesforce’s agentic AI workflows, focusing on customer-related data.“However, Informatica provides extensive value in the data management realm outside agentic workflows and customer related data,” Petrie said. “To realize the full value of this acquisition, I believe Salesforce will need to give the Informatica unit sufficient autonomy to continue to provide and extend its broad data management capabilities to its existing customers.”What it all means for enterprise usersSo, what does the acquisition mean for both Salesforce and Informatica enterprise customers?Forrester’s Yuhanna sees the acquisition as a major advancement for Salesforce customers. He noted that Salesforce customers will be able to seamlessly access and leverage all types of customer data, whether housed within Salesforce or external systems, all in real time. It represents a unified customer data fabric that can deliver actionable insights across every channel and touchpoint.“Critically, it accelerates Salesforce’s ability to deploy agentic AI, enabling low-code, low-maintenance AI solutions that reduce complexity and dramatically shorten time to value,” Yuhanna said. “With a fully integrated data management foundation, Salesforce customers can expect faster, more innovative, and more personalized customer experiences at scale.”The opportunity is equally appealing for Informatica customers. In Yuhanna’s view, this acquisition unlocks a faster path to agentic AI workloads, backed by the reach and power of the Salesforce ecosystem. As data management evolves, intelligent agents will automate core functions, turning traditionally time-consuming processes like data ingestion, integration,and pipeline orchestration into self-operating data workflows. Tasks that once took days or weeks will be executed with zero to little human intervention.“With a unified data, AI, and analytics platform, Informatica customers will benefit from accelerated innovation, greater operational agility, and significantly enhanced returns on their data investments,” he said.Daily insights on business use cases with VB DailyIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Griffin Gaming Partners led the round with a €10 million investment, with public investment bank Bpifrance also participating. The studio plans to put the funding towards development of its new and in-development titles, including Endless Legend 2, as well as grow out its team and community collaboration.Frankie Zhu, partner at Griffin, said in a statement, “We’re excited to partner with Amplitude Studios on their next chapter – they’ve created rich strategy-based franchises and plan to continue leveraging their depth of knowledge in the genre alongside their loyal community to create engaging universes. The team has a proven track record of excellence in releasing multiple titles that are both critically acclaimed and loved by their audiences.”The Amplitude Studios team.Last year, Amplitude Studios went independent from Sega, which acquired it in 2016. Now, according to the minds behind the studio, it plans to get back to its roots as a strategy game developer, starting with the aforementioned Endless Legend 2.Romain de Waubert de Genlis, Amplitude CEO, said in a statement, “We built Amplitude as an indie studio driven by passion and community. What’s exciting about regaining our independence through this partnership with Griffin is that it’s not about changing who we are, it’s about accelerating toward the future we’ve always envisioned. A future where we can fully realize our creative vision and deliver the immersive experiences our players expect. We’re already deep in development on what’s next—and we can’t wait to share it.”GB DailyStay in the know! Get the latest news in your inbox dailySubscribeRead ourPrivacy PolicyThanks for subscribing.

But that’s all changing this year.We already know thatAndroid 16will roll out soon, with June looking likely, while theSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7and theSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7will probably launch in July. So that makes it viable for them to launch with Android 16 out of the box, but until today we weren’t certain that would happen, since Samsung still needs time to make its own software modifications.However, the company hasnow confirmedthat these phones will ship with Android 16, which is likely to make them among the first handsets to run Android 16 out of the box.Android 16 on a Samsung phone(Image credit: Samsung)Faster than normalThis is slightly surprising since Samsung can often be slow to update its handsets, but the company claims this was achieved through “open communication” and “real-time feedback” with Google.Specifically, you’ll be getting One UI 8 on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7. This is Samsung’s customized take on Android 16, and – as you might have guessed – it puts a lot of focus on AI.That said, Samsung also highlights security and “convenient, intuitive tools” like allowing you to connect to Bluetooth audio devices effortlessly by scanning a QR code.Of course, you won’t have to buy one of Samsung’s upcoming foldables to get Android 16 and One UI 8 – the company has alreadylaunched a One UI 8 beta on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, so those devices will also probably get access to the finished version of this software soon after it’s available.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsYou might also likeThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 has been benchmarked, and the results are extremely disappointingThe Samsung Galaxy S26 could get a much-needed new cameraThe Samsung Galaxy S25 FE cameras have leaked, and they’re utterly underwhelmingSee more News about PhonesJames RogersonJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

Now, while this policy remains in place, you can try the service for a whole week without putting your hands on your wallet.One of thebest VPNservices out there, according to TechRadar's latest testing, Surfshark is now among the very few providers that offer new users a free trial option.Surfshark – 7-day free trialTry out all that Surfshark has to offer for 7 days on up to three different devices at once, completely free of charge. You can expect a host of security and privacy features, great streaming unblocking results, and fast connection speeds. If, after that, you decide to subscribe, you'll even be able to use the VPN service across unlimited devices simultaneously. No worry too much, though, as you'll still be able to change your mind thanks to its 30-day money-back guarantee.View DealWhy use Surfshark 7-day free trialAvirtual private network (VPN)is a crucial tool nowadays to boost your online experience as it allows you to enjoy a more private and secure internet, while enabling you to unlock otherwise geo-restricted content, among other things.Yet, not all VPN services are made equal. That's why we found the opportunity to test premium services without committing to a paid subscription very advantageous.As mentioned earlier, Surfshark isn't the onlyVPN with a free trialon the market – but it's perhaps the best option out there.For instance,CyberGhostoffers some shorter free trial options for new subscribers depending on the device they use – 24 hours for Windows and Mac users, 3 days on Android, and 7 days on iOS devices.Private Internet Accessalso offers a 7-day free trial, but only for Android and iOS users who activate it via the official app stores.NordVPNdoes something similar, but only for new Android subscribers.By contrast, any new users can enjoy Surfshark's 7-day free trial – no matter the device they use – and they can do so directly from the provider's official websites. Even better, Surfshark's free trial can be active on three devices at once.TechRadar needs you!We want to know what you think about the world of VPNs.

It appears they'll both launch in July 2025—around the time of Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event.The report follows previous news that generation eight of the Samsung Galaxy Watch linecould bring back the Classic form factor.

It includes the console itself, a digital copy ofMarioKart World,and a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.Stock could obviously vary depending on your location, but the webpage states that the Switch 2 \"is expected to be in stock and available for purchase soon\" and urges shoppers to \"check back again later.\"There is, however, still no sign thatNintendo Switch 2 pre-orderswill be available at CostCo. Furthermore, the retailer is limiting purchases to one unit every seven days. But after a week, it's realistic to expect Switch 2 stock to sell through entirely at CostCo given how difficult it has been to already secure a pre-order.As for price, CostCo hasn't disclosed this quite yet. But if I had to guess, given the addition of a 12-month NSO + Expansion Pack membership on top of the $499.99Mario Kart Worldbundle, I'd expect this bundle to go on sale for around $549.99.Likely not the most affordable bundle out there, then, but certainly one worth considering if you'd like a Switch 2 console on day one, and are running out of options elsewhere.You might also like...Nintendo has updated its Switch 2 game compatibility page, identifying over 100 titles with 'start up issues' on the upcoming consoleCheck your Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order ASAP, as some retailers are reportedly cancelling themPowerA reveals new line of Nintendo Switch 2 accessories including a wired controller with Hall effect thumbsticksGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsRhys WoodHardware EditorRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for more than two years.

    "content": "(Image credit: Shutterstock)The first major cloud computing breakthrough came in 2006, whenAmazonWeb Services (AWS) launched EC2 and S3. For the first time, businesses gained on-demand access to computing power and storage without owning physical servers. Fast forward to 2025, thecloud computingmodel is changing again!AI companies are under increasing pressure to move fast and manage mounting computing needs, all while balancing environmental impact and operational costs. Complexity keeps growing and the cracks in traditional cloud infrastructure are becoming harder to ignore. Enter decentralized mesh hyperscalers: cloud networks that dynamically share idle resources, push computing closer to the source of data and enable localized processing.As the cloud evolves from a static location to a responsive network, this new infrastructure meets the realities of AI development head-on.Tobias AdlerCEO and Founder of nuco.cloud.Outgrowing The Old Cloud? Meet Decentralized Mesh HyperscalersOnce thought of as limitless, the cloud is now stretched beyond its original design. Not to mention, maintenance costs are rising. In fact, small to mid-sized companies now spend upwards of $1.2 million a year on cloud services. This figure is projected to rise even higher. To keep up, many turned to multi-cloud strategies.In 2022, already 89% of businesses had adopted multi-cloud frameworks in an effort to gain flexibility and reduce reliance on a single provider. But this patchwork approach is proving difficult to manage. Instead of creating flow, traditional cloud setups often cause friction because they are mismatched to the high-volume nature of AI development.The solution isn’t simply “more cloud.” It’s a rethinking of the cloud itself.Infrastructure Built Around AI WorkloadsFor AI companies, decentralized mesh hyperscalers offer a rethink of how cloud infrastructure can meet day-to-day demands.Cloud infrastructure slowing development and deployment down? Rather than relying on a single, centralized hub, mesh architectures distribute computing power across a network of nodes, like a spiderweb. This approach builds resilience by design: if one node fails, others pick up the slack, minimizing downtime and maintaining system stability. And because data is processed closer to where it’s needed, latency drops, performance improves, and teams can move faster. This is theinfrastructurelayer AI has been waiting for!It’s not just a technical improvement, it’s a foundational shift in how we think about the internet:From owningserversto sharing computing across networks,From a few big players to many contributors,From global control to local autonomy.By eliminating lags, bottlenecks and resource-heavy processes, mesh hyperscalers don’t just patch up a rigid cloud system – they change the foundation to support smarter growth. How useful is that for global operations?Can your companies slash cloud costs and reduce environmental impact? Turns out, yesIt needs to be said that AI’s hunger for computing power isn’t slowing down. Traininglarge language modelsor deep learning systems translates directly into massive energy consumption.Today, data centers account for about 3% of global carbon emissions. By 2030, they’re projected to consume up to 13% of the world’s electricity. For businesses trying to scale AI capabilities while staying true to ESG goals, that math doesn’t work.Here’s the good news. Instead of relying on centralized data centers that often sit idle, mesh infrastructure taps into a distributed pool of underutilized computing resources. It’s a more efficient use of what already exists, reducing the need to build new energy-hungry infrastructure. This means less environmental impact without compromising AI development and deployment.The savings aren’t just environmental either. The traditional cloud model locks teams into pre-booked capacity or long waits for high-performance GPUs, especially during peak demand. Every training run, test or tweak becomes a budgetary and scheduling challenge. Mesh hyperscalers sidestep that. By dynamically allocating resources based on availability and need, they enable AI teams to access computing on demand. Less waiting, better resource allocation.Not convinced on this new technology yet? Decentralized mesh hyperscalers clean up the chaos that traditional multi-cloud environments tend to create. Integrating legacy systems, juggling between providers, managing inconsistent geographic protocols – for AI ops teams, this is just a regular day at the office.Mesh infrastructure solves this by offering a unified layer that connects everything: old systems, new platforms, different providers. What is frequently a fragmented ecosystem now has control and cohesion because everything is working together.AI’s Future Isn’t In The Cloud… It Is The CloudSo there you have it. Decentralized mesh hyperscalers are where the cloud is going next and AI companies are well positioned to lead the way in establishing this technology. This isn’t about chasing trends. It’s about aligning technological progression with the future of cloud infrastructure.Too often, cloud adoption is treated as a box to tick rather than a strategic move. The result? Bloated systems and scalability that falters when it matters most. Mesh infrastructure changes that. It’s not just about speed or efficiency. It’s about building smarter, more resilient, and future-ready operations from the ground up.For AI companies focused on meaningful growth and long-term impact, the path forward isn’t just in the cloud. It’s through a new kind of cloud – one that’s distributed, dynamic and designed to scale. There’s little value in resisting this shift. To truly unlock the best benefits, especially in the face of growing demands like global expansion and long-term scalability, organizations need to approach cloud transformation with intent.I tried 70+ best AI tools.This article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

    "content": "(Image credit: Apple)Apple's just dropped a pretty significant upgrade to Logic Pro for Mac and iPadFlashback Capture will handle the recording even if you don't start itStem Splitters gains more functionality, and a bit of Apple Intelligence arrives in this creative toolApple’s been on a roll with Logic Pro on the Mac and iPad – in 2024, the tech giantushered in several AI-powered features, including an impressive Stem Splitter, and now, for the first major update of 2025, you could say it’s turning things up to 11.Leading the improvements for both the Mac and iPad is a new tool that will save your brilliant take, even if you forget to hit the record button. Beyond that, Stem Splitter is an even more powerful tool, andApple Intelligenceis arriving within the long-standing Notepad functionality.So let’s start with Flashback Capture – this is a renaming of ‘Capture Recording’ and an expansion of its capabilities. Whether you’re a pro at Logic or maybe just upgrading from GarageBand, you’ve likely experienced this when you start strumming on a guitar, sing a few chords, or play another instrument – greatness strikes, but you forget to hit record. This feature has the potential to be a lifesaver, as it automatically captures your performance before you hit record.(Image credit: Apple)With the press of a button, you can then make it appear on your timeline. As part of its rebranding, Flashback Capture now works with any MIDI source – or, more accurately, with any audio source. It also works if you play something while listening to another piece of your timeline – when inspiration strikes, regardless of whether you start recording, Flashback Capture kind of saves the day. This update is now available for Mac with Logic Pro 11.2 and for iPad with Logic Pro version 2.2, both of which are now available.The ever-popular Stem Splitter, which utilizes AI to analyze an audio file and separate the instruments or vocals into individual tracks, is receiving an enhancement. Previously, it could separate vocals, bass, and drums into separate tracks while placing other potential elements into a track called “other.”Now, Apple is adding the ability to recognize piano and guitar, while also promising better audio fidelity. This should be pretty helpful, though if you have a horn section in your band, those wonderful brass instruments will still live in the ‘other’ track. There will also be presets to pick from, including a cappella, instrumental with vocals, or just instrumental. Stem Splitter will still only be available on Macs and iPads withApple Siliconinside, specifically the M1 chip or newer.(Image credit: Apple)While there is some AI and machine learning, Apple is also incorporating Writing Tools integration. Essentially, the Notepad tool inside Logic Pro will now have a dedicated button forWriting Tools, allowing you to leverage Apple’s own models orChatGPT’s smartsto help flesh out lyrics, potentially.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsIf you’re keen on new sound packs, Logic Pro on the Mac is gaining Magnetic Imperfections and Tosin Abasi, while the iPad version gets the brand-new Dancefloor Rush. The latter here offers alchemy patches and hundreds of loops, all themed around drum and bass. It sounds a lot like summer pop and should be fun.(Image credit: Apple)Lastly, for Logic Pro on iPad, Learn MIDI is arriving and will help you get the hang of these physical control devices with minimal previous experience. Essentially, you can plug a compatible MIDI device into your iPad via USB-C and then assign a function in Logic Pro to a physical control, such as a knob. You’ll be able to customize the experience to your exact needs, and as they evolve, you can adjust your setup accordingly.The best news, though, and keeping with Apple’s past enhancements to the software suite, is that if you’ve already bought Logic Pro for the Mac or subscribe to Logic Pro for iPad, you’ll get all these new features for free.Apple’s also not increasing the cost for either. Logic Pro for the Mac is still a one-time purchase of $199.99 / £199.99 / AU$ 299.99 and Logic Pro for iPad is $5.99 / £4.99 / AU$7.99 or annually at $49.99 / £49.99 / AU$59.99.Additionally, you can still get a one-month free trial on the iPad or a 90-day free trial on the Mac for Logic.You might also likeI created these wild AI videos in Veo 3 and here's how you can do it tooDisneyland turns 70, and it's celebrating with MagicBand+, LED spectacles, and next-gen showsApple might be close to launching a dedicated hub for gaming on the Mac, iPhone, and iPadSee more Computing NewsTOPICSJacob KrolUS Managing Editor NewsJacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

    "content": "(Image credit: Apple)A new report from Bloomberg says Apple will change how it numbers its operating systemsThe change will be to match the year, so not iOS 19 but iOS 26It's said the change will be for iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS as wellWith just 12 days untilApple’s WWDC 2025kicks off on June 9, 2025, with an opening keynote, rumors and reports are coming in hot about what the tech giant might announce. Given that it’s theWorldwide Developers Conference, we’re expecting CEOTim Cookand a slew of executives to walk us through the next generation of platforms.Up until a new report, we fully expectediOS 19andiPadOS 19, the next generation of macOS with a unique spot in California, giving it a name, and new versions of watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS, all going up by one number.According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, though,Applemight be throwing a curveball and ditching the concept of naming the software by the next generational number. The report states that instead of unveiling iOS 19, the successor to iOS 18, Apple will introduce iOS 26.(Image credit: Future)“The next Appleoperating systemswill be identified by year, rather than with a version number,” the report reads. Alongside iOS jumping to 26, it appears that Apple might roll out iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and maybe most shockingly, visionOS 26. The latter would be the most significant jump, as we currently only have visionOS 2, and theVision Proas a whole is not an aging device.It appears that Apple’s change, at least as described in this report, is aimed at clearing up some confusion and establishing uniformity in its branding. The new naming convention is rumored to arrive along with a far-reaching design refresh dubbed “solarium” that is expected to affect every one of Apple’s platforms – iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS included.I’m personally excited about the more transparent design refresh for the iPhone’s software and the rest of the platforms; it’ll reinvigorate and make the whole experience feel a bit cleaner, at least I think so. However, this new naming convention is a bit more confusing to me – Apple seems to be taking an approach similar to car manufacturers, naming its software for the year ahead.That feels a little confusing on paper, but I’m curious to see how Apple explains this on stage. It could also signal that the now delayed AI-powered Siri – the landmark feature of Apple Intelligence – may not land until 2026 – though that’s really anyone's guess for an arrival.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors(Image credit: Apple/Future)Apple wouldn’t be the first company to take a leap of faith with its naming conventions.Samsungjumped from the Galaxy S10 family to theGalaxy S20, and Microsoft has tried this for a few years, then reverted to generational numbers.The new naming strategy for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS, won’t be the only news or changes, though.

That attitude will now be available to all users, having previously been limited to some premium Telegram users.Telegram CEO Pavel Durov shared a video on X showing how users will be able to pin Grok to the top of chats, summon it from the search bar, and use it to do all sorts of activities; from writing messages and summarizing group chats to creating stickers, answering trivia, and even serving as a moderator in community groups.Elon Musk’s AI company signed a deal with Telegram to embed Grok as a feature throughout the platform, paying $300 million for the privilege. Telegram is also getting 50% of the revenue from any Grok subscriptions purchased through the app, which could turn this into one of the most lucrative crossovers in chatbot history.🔥 This summer, Telegram users will gain access to the best AI technology on the market. @elonmusk and I have agreed to a 1-year partnership to bring xAI’s @grok to our billion+ users and integrate it across all Telegram apps 🤝💪 This also strengthens Telegram’s financial… pic.twitter.com/ZPK550AyRVMay 28, 2025Grok at workIf this all sounds vaguely familiar, that’s because it sounds a lot like Meta's strategy for Meta AI. The AI assistant has become part of Facebook, Instagram, andWhatsAppin a similar fashion to Grok in Telegram. Grok serves as Telegram’s answer to Meta AI, encouraging people to stay on the platform rather than look elsewhere for help from an AI source.The $300 million being paid by xAI may sound over-the-top, but it makes sense when you consider what xAI gets out of it. Telegram is one of the most-used messaging apps on the planet. Getting even a fraction of the more than 900 million monthly active Telegram users to try Grok would be a massive boon for the chatbot. And that's not even considering the value of the data Grok will get from Telegram users. It's a massive pool of real-time interaction data, which could fuel Grok's development in ways xAI is eager to pursue.Since the real power of AI data comes from how real people interact, $300 million might end up being a bargain. Grok can learn a lot from what hundreds of millions of people ask, how they phrase things, and what tone they use, depending on whether they're happy, mad, flirty, or confused. xAI now has a front-row seat to that data firehose.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsNaturally, the Grok integration will raise a few eyebrows when questions of privacy, data ownership, and how our data is used are brought up. Neither xAI nor Telegram has provided much detail about how Grok will handle user data or whether any of that data will be used to further train the model, which one must assume will be the case.Grok may become the helpful assistant it's pitched as, or it could be another feature that people Google how to turn off, just like Meta AI. There’s also the question of moderation.Durov demonstrated how Grok might help clean up spammy group chats, but Grok's tone would likely clash with a Telegram group discussing sensitive issues, and things could go very wrong if Grok misinterprets the context in a heated argument.You might also likeGrok may start remembering everything you ask it to do, according to new reportsI tried Grok’s new AI image editing features – they’re fun but won’t replace Photoshop any time soonGrok 3’s voice mode is unhinged, and that’s the pointSee more Computing NewsEric Hal SchwartzContributorEric Hal Schwartz is a freelance writer for TechRadar with more than 15 years of experience covering the intersection of the world and technology.

    "content": "(Image credit: Antonio Guillem / Shutterstock)Microsoft has a grand vision of Windows Update delivering updates for all software installed on the PCThis is mainly aimed at the business world to begin with, but there’s no reason why consumers won’t eventually benefit as wellDevelopers will need to be persuaded to hook up their apps to Microsoft’s new unified delivery platform, thoughMicrosoftplans to haveWindows 11itself handle all software updates via the Windows Update system, or that appears to be the idea for the future.The Verge spotteda Microsoftblog postthat outlined a vision of the “unified future for app updates on Windows,” as penned by product manager Angie Chen.While this is a post on the IT Pro blog, and as such it’s targeted at IT admins and organizations, as Microsoft pushes forward in this direction, there’s no reason why consumers won’t benefit from this too.This is surely the plan, even if it isn’t mentioned explicitly, as the post announces that a private preview of the new system is now kicking off, which any app developer can join to start getting their software ready for Microsoft’s brave new world of updates.As it stands now, Windows Update provides relevant updates for theoperating systemitself (of course) and related frameworks, as well as drivers sometimes. When it comes to individual apps – or suites of software – you are reliant on the developer to deliver these through their own mechanisms.Microsoft wants to change this by introducing a “Windows-native update orchestration platform” that allows any app developer to make use of Windows Update to deliver patches for their software alongsideregular Windows 11 updates.As Microsoft explains, there are several benefits to working in this way, not the least of which is that it keeps things simple and streamlined to get all your updates from one source.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsAdditionally, you’ll be able to view a history of all updates across your entire PC via the update history in theWindows 11Settings app. Furthermore, developers will be able to use the operating system’s powers in terms of deciding when to apply updates, such as obeying the user's or admin’s time windows for updating, for example.Analysis: A sensible path forward(Image credit: Future/Jacob Krol)All this makes some sense, and the convenience of combining all updates under one hub managed by Windows itself is surely taking a step forward.After all, with updates reliant on the delivery methods of individual software developers, it can be easy to fall behind, especially if the update mechanism is tucked away somewhere and doesn’t happen automatically. Or indeed, if you don’t run a piece of software for ages, it could be hanging around in the background in a miserably unpatched state.With Windows Update handling all this, you’d be on top of your software updates consistently, at least in theory. That said, cynics might be quick to pounce on the reliability of Windows Update.Failed installations of updates are not exactly uncommon and arereported with some regularity. However, remember that these are updates for Windows 11 itself – more complex, knotty OS upgrades – and small app updates are unlikely to suffer any such wrinkles. And whether they do, or not, will presumably be down to the devs anyway, to a large extent.It’s worth noting that you do get updates piped through to Windows apps automatically with software installed via theMicrosoft Store, but of course, far from every developer wants to use that store.Worried about app support, and some software being left out? Every base should be covered, with support for all common app types (not just Microsoft’s own creations, such asMSIX apps), as outlined in the blog post.However, there could still be a catch here, namely that it’s up to software developers to use Microsoft’s new platform. And nothing is forcing them to hook up to the system, so will they bother?That’s the multi-million-dollar question, but from my perspective, it all seems a sensible enough idea. While this may be a plan targeting the business world initially, I can envision a broader move towards this model of Windows updates for all kinds of app developers eventually.

    "content": "(Image credit: Future)Acer accidentally listed RTX 5050 GPUs in some gaming laptopsThe spilled details showed power usage and clock speedsWe didn’t get any other specs shared, though, and chatter about the desktop variant of the RTX 5050 has gone quiet, tooAcerhas leaked theNvidiaRTX 5050 mobile GPU, giving us a glimpse of some of the key specs of this laptop graphics card.Not so long ago,Nvidia introduced RTX 5060 models(the 5060 Ti spin came first), and before those arrived, there wererumors flying around about them and the RTX 5050,too.While the RTX 5050 hasn’t been officially announced, we’ve been seeing numerous leaks about it recently.VideoCardz reportsthat the latest leak comes from Acer, courtesy of a list of GPU specs for Predator and Nitro gaming laptops.This mentioned an RTX 5050 in quite a few of the Nitro notebooks, and I use the past tense there because Acer has caught the error and deleted the offending listings – but not before VideoCardz took a screenshot as evidence. Other sources have also taken note, so this is likely genuine – although still take it with a grain of salt, as with all rumors.We can see from this screengrab that Acer is set to offer the RTX 5050 in five different power options, ranging from 50W up to 100W, with correspondingly faster clock speeds for each, from 1500MHz up to 2550MHz. Note that there’ll also be an ‘Acer OC’ (overclocked) boost of 15W with these models, meaning the most powerful model will be able to provide 115W in a pinch.Sadly, we don’t see any specifications other than power usage and clocks, which are tied together in a direct relationship – the faster the clocks are pushed, the more wattage the GPU will consume.Analysis: A laptop RTX 5050 feels imminent – but what about the desktop model?(Image credit: Peter Hoffmann)The specs we see here don’t give us much of a clue as to how powerful the RTX 5050 will theoretically be. That said, the maximum power envelope advertised is quite substantial at 115W, but we don’t know enough about this mobile GPU to draw any definitive conclusions. Key factors will include the core count, which isn’t disclosed, and the type of video memory (VRAM) used.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsI should note that on the latter front, there were rumors thatNvidia could opt for slower GDDR6 VRAM, rather than the GDDR7 employed elsewhere with the Blackwell generation. However, more recent rumors have suggested Nvidia will stick with GDDR7 (8GB of this VRAM, which is an expected configuration for an entry-level GPU).At any rate, what this apparent mistake from Acer does indicate is that the RTX 5050 laptop graphics card could be close to arriving, otherwise it wouldn’t be popping up on spec sheets – and this is backed up by the fact that we’ve had a lot of leaks around this GPU recently. Indeed, one of those mentioned aplanned launch date of Q2 for the RTX 5050, and so a June release appears to be a distinct possibility at this point.In other words, we might be seeing the revelation of the Nvidia RTX 5050 for laptops in the next week or two. What about the desktop RTX 5050? Yes, it’s rumored Nvidia is going to produce a desktop flavor of this bottom-tier Blackwell GPU, which runs counter to what happened with the previous Lovelace generation (there was no desktop RTX 4050, only a laptop variant).However, any gossip around the desktop RTX 5050 seems to have dried up, giving me pause for thought on whether Nvidia might have abandoned that idea, at least for the time being. Or maybe it was never happening in the first place; we never know with rumors.I’m really hoping Nvidia can provide a more affordable desktop GPU forbudget gaming PCsthis time around, though, but whether that’ll actually happen is something I’ve always been doubtful about. Simply because of how Nvidia has neglected the budget end of thegraphics card spectrumin more recent times.You might also likeNvidia confirms another black screen bug, and it’s a nasty one hitting RTX 5060 GPUs this time – but a fix has been rushed outRumored Nvidia RTX 5080 Super specs disappoint some gamers, but I don’t think there’s anything to worry about with this GPUAMD could be working on a faster RX 9070 Extreme graphics cardSee more Computing NewsTOPICSDarren AllanDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

And now there's a new push: how to make them sound.As spotted byScience Daily, researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH for short) have created a 13-inchOLEDpanel where every pixel makes sound as well as light.And that tech could one day deliver multi-channel sound with incredible precision – without requiring speaker drivers.Pixels should be heard as well as seen(Image credit: Wiley / POSTECH)As Science Daily reports (hat tip toNotebookcheck), the team have called their invention 'Pixel-Based Local Sound OLED technology'. And as they explain, the problem with TV audio is that it's really hard to get accurate positional sound with conventional speakers.\"The core issue is that traditional exciters – devices that vibrate to produce sound – are large and heavy, making it difficult to deploy multiple units without interference or compromising the OLED's thin design,\" the researchers say. \"Additionally, sound crosstalk between multiple speakers leads to a lack of precise control over localized audio.\"Their solution was to embed piezo-electric exciters within the OLED display frame. \"These piezo exciters, arranged similarly to pixels, convert electrical signals into sound vibrations without occupying external space. Crucially, they are fully compatible with the thin form factor of OLED panels.\"That enables each pixel to become an independent sound source, and the team says that they were able to completely eliminate crosstalk – so that sounds coming from different parts of the display didn't interfere with one another.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsThe applications of the technology go beyond TVs. One suggestion is that in-car displays could send different audio to different people, for example by giving vocal directions to the driver while the passenger listens to music. And in phones or headsets the audio could change as the head, hand or device moves.According to Professor Su Seok Choi, \"This technology has the potential to become a core feature of next-generation devices, enabling sleek, lightweight designs in smartphones, laptops, and automotive displays – while delivering immersive, high-fidelity audio.\"The \"has the potential\" bit is key, however: this is a proof of concept, not a product – and there's a big difference between producing audio and producingexcellentaudio.

    "content": "(Image credit: Epic Games / Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock)Apple may be developing a dedicated gaming app for iOS, macOS and moreThe app will contain things like achievements, leaderboards and messagesIt could be announced at WWDC in JuneFor years,Applehas been trying to convince the world that it’s taking gaming seriously, and with the popularity of IOS gaming and the appearance of AAA titles likeCyberpunk 2077on macOS, there’s some truth to the company’s assertion.Just in case you needed more convincing, there’s a new rumor fromBloomberg reporter Mark Gurmanthat Apple will soon launch adedicated gaming appiniOS 19to woo players to its platforms. As a Mac-owning gamer, I'm cautiously optimistic about the rumors – even if we still need more affordable hardware and games before it gets anywhere close to being a Windows competitor.If you missed the news, the app will apparently “serve as a launcher for titles and centralize in-game achievements, leaderboards, communications and other activity,” Gurman said, adding that it will also feature “editorial content from Apple about new titles, offer access to the App Store’s game section and promote [Apple] Arcade.” It’s expected to be revealed on iOS, macOS, iPadOS and tvOS as soon asApple’s WWDC 2025 eventon June 9.The move makes sense – after all, the iPhone is a phenomenally popular gaming platform, and announcing a move like this atWWDCcould help to cement the popularity of iOS 19 before it’s even out the door. Apple might also be hoping that it will tempt more gamers to switch from Windows to the Cupertino firm’s platforms – but on this point, I’m not entirely convinced.Destination of choice for gamers(Image credit: Apple)This app might work well in iOS 19, where gaming tends to bea little more casualthan on desktop computers. But things might look very different on macOS.As a gamer who also owns a Mac, I’ve been encouraged over the last few years by Apple’s strides in the gaming world. It’s nowhere near parity with Windows yet, but the situation today is much better than it was just a few years ago.For a long time, the problem was the chicken-and-egg nature of Mac gaming. Gamers didn’t want to switch to macOS due to the lack of games, and developers didn’t want to bring games to the Mac due to the lack of players. That’s slowly starting to change, with big-name titles likeCyberpunk 2077,Assassin’s Creed Shadows, andBaldur’s Gate 3helping to dispel the idea that the Mac is a gaming wasteland.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsHowever, the impact of a dedicated gaming app will likely be limited. Beyond my contention that gamers care more about hardware and game availability than launcher apps, Gurman is also skeptical, saying that “testers of the software say it probably won’t change the perception among players and makers of high-end titles.”Any advance for gaming on Apple’s platforms is welcome in my eyes, and this app could help by making gaming more prominent among users of iOS and macOS. But what’s really needed – on the Mac at least – is a greater number of attention-grabbing titles and more affordable access to components that offer exceptional gaming performance.Until that happens, Windows will always be the destination of choice for gamers.You might also likeApple might be close to launching a dedicated hub for gaming on the Mac, iPhone, and iPadTurns out, people don’t really want console games on iPhone – but I think that misses the pointBest Mac games 2025: the best Apple-friendly gaming experiences you can getSee more News about PhonesTOPICSAlex BlakeFreelance ContributorAlex Blake has been fooling around with computers since the early 1990s, and since that time he's learned a thing or two about tech.

It runs the MicroMac 128K emulator, which provides the vintage Macoperating systemflavor. That means it’s a fully working computer, although whether it’s actuallypracticalis another matter.You can buy the fully assembled Pico-Mac-Nano for a mere $59 (around £44 / AU$92) – so much for theAppletax. Alternatively, 1-bit Rainbow has supplied the 3D printing files if you want to print your own case and flash a regular Pico Raspberry Pi yourself.There’s even a specialCollectors Editionof the Pico-Mac-Nano that comes in a small-scale replica of Apple’s original ‘Picasso’ Macintosh shipping box.

Since its launch 16 years ago the brand has released many more cooling, heating and air-purifying products with increasingly advanced features, but the Dyson Cool hasn't seen an upgrade – until now.The next-gen model, called the Dyson Cool CF1, has the same powerful airflow and sleek, blade-less design, but adds some helpful features and usability tweaks to bring it in line with the rest of thebest fanson the market. It's not as big or splashy as some of the brand's other launches, but it delivers exactly what I want from a tabletop fan.(Image credit: Dyson)So what's new? Firstly, you have more customization options to play with. The oscillation settings have been extended – you can now choose between 15, 40 and 70 degrees of oscillation (or no oscillation at all) – and you've now got 10 fan speeds to play with.Dyson has added a Night mode, which automatically dims the displays and adjusts fan speed for cooling that'll help you drop off, rather than being distracting. This is combined with a new sleep timer that shuts off the fan when you're (hopefully) happily away in the land of nod. There's also an LCD screen, which shows at a glance what mode you're in and which airflow setting you're using.(Image credit: Dyson)Elsewhere, there's still an energy-efficient brushless DC motor, and it uses Dyson's patented 'Air Multiplier' technology, which can apparently amplify the air around it by up to 13 times. As with all Dyson's fans, there are no blades, which means smooth and even airflow, and a design that's safer and far easier to keep clean.There are no air purification (or heating, or humidifying) functions, as appear on otherDyson fans in the wider range. The Dyson Cool FC1 is focused entirely on efficient personal cooling.(Image credit: Dyson)\"The original bladeless fan revolutionized the way we think about airflow, combining cutting-edge engineering with sleek, safe, and efficient design,\" says Logan Thomson, Dyson Design Engineer. \"This latest iteration builds on those core benefits by introducing modern upgrades like intelligent features, including sleep mode, to meet the demands of today’s customers.”Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsThe Dyson Cool CF1 goes on sale in the UK on May 28 priced at £249.99, at Dyson Demo stores or online atDyson.co.uk.

It also contained code associated with open source post-exploitation framework SilentTrinity and StormKitty stealer.VenomRAT is a lightweight RAT that cybercriminals use to gain control over compromised Windows systems. It enables the theft of login credentials, and allows threat actors to log keystrokes, access webcams, and run additional commands, remotely.In this case, Domaintools says the goal was to steal people’s cryptocurrency and then sell the access to a different threat actor, saying there is “clear intent to target individuals for financial gain by compromising their credentials, crypto wallets, and potentially selling access to their systems.”Are you a pro?

Tap on someone or something in an image, and even more suggestions appear, such as the option to move the selection somewhere else in the picture, or blur the background behind it.Tools that have previously been exclusive to theGoogle Pixel 9series are now going to be available for everyone. They include Auto Frame for getting suggested crops for a shot, and Reimagine, which works like a mini AI image generator to let you introduce new elements or edit existing ones with text prompts.Other examples provided by Google include getting suggestions as to how to enhance a particular area of a photo, and changing the look of the sky using the Reimagine tool – so you can turn a cloudy day into a sunny one, if you want to.

    "content": "(Image credit: Future)It was just a glimpse, two 8-second Veo 3 videos, but as with so many life-altering things, I'll never forget my first time generating synchronized audio and video with one deftly crafted prompt.I'm currently running Google AI Pro, the $19.99 a month account that gives you access to the Gemini 2.5 Pro model and, more importantly, a limited trial of Veo 3 video generation.Veo 3is the tipping-point level of generative video creation that, for the first time, makes it possible to create videos with dialogue, background noises and sound effects, all synced to the action.While I understood that my Veo 3 access might be limited, I wasn't sure how many videos I could generate with the new model. The answer, it seems, is exactly two. If I want unlimited access, I can switch to Google AI Ultra for an eye-watering $249.99 a month (there's a three-month deal for $124.99 a month). And Veo 3 is currently US-only.Since Veo 3 launched atGoogle I/O 2025, my TikTok feed has been filled with theseincredible and often quite realistic AI clips. Some look like infomercials or commercials, others are just impossible, like a woman interviewing a smiling man who is clearly on fire.I was torn between creating realism, hyper-realism, and something fantastic. In the end, I built a prompt in the Gemini 2.5 Pro window that supports video creation that was a mix of sci-fi, drama, and whimsy.Writing inside the prompt window, though, turned out to be a mistake because I accidentally hit return before fully fleshing out my idea, and suddenly Veo 3 was busy generating my video.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsThis was my first prompt:\"Bill and Jessica live in a log cabin built on the surface of Mars. Bill emerges from the cabin to find jessica fighting a martian using nothing but a stuffed animal.Bill screams at Jessica: What are you doing?Jessica: This damn martian wants our land and he can't have it.\"As you can see, there isn't much detail, and as easy as it is to generate a video in Veo 3 (and the audio-free Veo 2), you'll get a better result by including more detail and dialogue. Veo 3 will not have the characters say anything you didn't script. In this case, because I hit return too soon, Jessica's dialogue is cut off and I didn't get to polish my prompt.Even so, Veo 3 took the scant details and in roughly 5 minutes created a striking piece of video. Take a look (sound up for the full effect).My first Veo 3 video: A cabin on Mars pic.twitter.com/AT63w2lqDmMay 28, 2025It's far from perfect. Bill doesn't actually speak his line, though we hear it from off-camera. Jessica's scream (or is it the Martian's?) also comes from somewhere off camera.There's an unfortunate sound effect that might be coming from Bill, and that I did not script. Also, I don't know why Jessica speaks her lines directly to camera.Again, I assume that had I directed who she should be talking to, Veo 3 might have made a different choice.Still, there are so many more subtle things that are impressive. Veo 3 gets the setting right; notice the reddish overcast of Mars daylight. The Martian is terrifying. I'm more impressed, though, by the sound effects like the sound of the cabin door, footfalls on the Martian soil, and the sound of the stuffed animal hitting the Martian's chest.Take 2For my second prompt, I wrote and edited it outside of Gemini. I did my best to set the scene, describe the characters, and delineate the dialogue and any sound effects. Here's the prompt:The scene is a lush forest with sunlight streaming in from overhead. We hear the shrieks of pterodactyls in the background and the sound of leaves swaying in a light breeze.A Tyrannosaurus is carefully painting a large canvas that depicts a colorful image of a man about to be destroyed by an asteroid.The Tyrannosaurus is quietly singing to himself, “Pink Pony Club, I’m gonna keep on dancing at the...”A Velociraptor wanders over and asks, “Why are you painting that?”The Tyrannosaurus: “The AI made me do it.”The Velociraptor backs away in horror and says, “The what?!!”As you can see, I was, in part, inspired by some of the self-referential Veo 3 videos I'd been seeing on TikTok where the characters break the fourth wall and mention they're AIs in a video. While my detail work mostly paid off, Veo did make a number of questionable choices.I don't know why it chose to dress the T-Rex but neglected to give him a paintbrush, or why the character in the painting looks like some sort of 1970s kid detective. And while Gemini clearly knows a thing or two about what dinosaurs look like, it got the relative sizes of the T-Rex and Velociraptor all wrong. I was also disappointed that instead of \"shrieks of pterodactyls,\" I got a static image of pterodactyls and the sound of birdsong in the background.The dialogue sync is mostly good, though I was hoping for more emoting from the velociraptor.Overall, it took me a few minutes to write these prompts and another 3-to-5 minutes for Veo 3 to generate each video. I believe that if I spent more time painting a detailed picture, even writing a whole short story, I might get an even better result.I'd let you know for sure, but I just ran my brief trial dry. If you plan on attending a couple of Veo 3 videos, here are my core tips:Write your prompt outside of GeminiChoose your topics carefullySpell out every detail, from the look of the characters to the sceneDetail every action, or Veo 3 will make something up or have a character doing nothingSpell out the dialogue so it's clear.Describe the emotion behind dialogue deliveryInclude details on background noisesInclude sound effect descriptions if you desire specific soundsEach video is 8 seconds maximum. Plan accordinglyTry creating multiple videos that continue a storyline, but keep descriptions consistentGood luck with your Veo 3 test drives.

The company did start to tentatively bring operations back online.“MathWorks experienced a ransomware attack. We have notified federal law enforcement of this matter. The attack affected our IT systems,” the status page reads. “Some of our online applications used by customers became unavailable, and certain internal systems used by staff became unavailable, beginning on Sunday, May 18. We have brought many of these systems back online and are continuing to bring other systems back online with the assistance of cybersecurity experts.”Negotiations ongoing?The newest update, posted on May 27, says MATLAB Answers, Cloud Center, and File Exchange, have been restored for existing users. The latter is operating “in a degraded state with file viewing and GitHub sync not yet enabled.”MathWorks is best known for MATLAB and Simulink, two popular solutions used worldwide for data analysis, simulation, and model-based design in engineering and scientific applications, with its products used by more than 100,000 organizations and more than 5 million customers across the world.At press time, there was no information about the perpetrators, as no threat actors have yet claimed responsibility for the attack, and crucial details are still missing.We don’t know who the threat actors are, or if they stole any sensitive company or customer data from MathWorks’ systems, as is the usual practice with ransomware attacks.Are you a pro?

Everyone else from Cech onwards, though, is new to the show.Speaking of Cech, she was cast as fan-favorite character Toph in November 2024.

Please welcome Miya Cech to Avatar: The Last Airbender Season 2. #GeekedWeek pic.twitter.com/p7V7akclraSeptember 20, 2024There have been plenty more cast reveals since Cech was added to the show's roster, too.

The most notable name among this contingent is Dichen Lachman, who some viewers will recognize as Gemma Scout/Ms Casey from the hugely successfulApple TV+series Severance. She'll be playing Yangchen in Avatar season 2.A post shared by Avatar: The Last Airbender (@avatarnetflix)A photo posted by onFor Commander Zhao (Ken Leung), he appears to meet his demise in the season 1 finale following a battle with Zuko, who unleashes his fire powers upon him. Asked byRadioTimes.comabout his potential return, Leung said, “In the original, we do know what happens to him – he ends up in the Fog of Lost Souls in the spirit world. As this is a re-imagining, I don’t know how that part of it will be re-imagined, if it will be, so I’m in the same boat as you!”Avatar: The Last Airbender season 2 story speculationSuki and Sokka will continue to support Aang in battle(Image credit: Netflix)Major spoilers follow forAvatar: The Last Airbenderseason 1. Potential season 2 spoilers also follow.When it comes to the originalAvatar: The Last Airbenderseries, there’s certainly a storyline and timeline for Netfli'sx adaptation to follow. One of the biggest issues that Netflix’s version faces, though, is that the original took place across the same 12-month period.By keeping the same cast in this remake, season 1 showrunner Albert Kim had to allow for the actors to grow up on screen. Given they'll have aged up since the first season was released, a narrative tweak was needed in the form of including a time jump, as Kim previously confirmed in a chat withEntertainment Weekly(EW).How does this impact the arrival of Sozin’s Comet, aka the celestial object that depicts the passage of time in the original show? Kim added: \"We removed that particular ticking clock from our show for now because we couldn’t know exactly how old our actors would be for the subsequent seasons.\"Season 1's mid-credits scene revealed Sozin’s Comet would be part of the story moving forward, though, so it'll be interesting to see how its inclusion factors into the time jump that's been introduced inAvatar: The Last Airbenderseason 2.Aang will be older than the last time we saw them(Image credit: Netflix)Elsewhere, in conversation with Netflix's in-houseTudum, website, executive producers Christine Boylan and Jabbar Raisani revealed a bit more about what viewers can expect next time around.\"We’re going to challenge our characters with more complex and nuanced obstacles as they navigate a more tactile world,\" the pair teased. \"Just as the animated series matured and progressed, the live- action will also take these characters and worlds, and grow them.\"The show's exploration of more mature themes won't be a surprise to anyone who watched Netflix's remake and/or the original.Where the former is concerned, Aang and the Waterbenders successfully repelled the Fire Nation's attack on the Northern Water Tribe at Agna Qel’a. Unfortunately, the Fire Nation simultaneously attacked the Earthbenders in the city of Omashu and were successful in defeating those defending their tribal stronghold.This sets the plot up nicely for the Earthbending focus of season 2, which matches the original series. More training, more harnessing of skills, and more battles for Aang and company are certainly on the cards, then.\"I thought it was really clever of the writers to end season 1 in that way, because you want to get a sense that the universe of the show is expanding with every season,\" Daniel Dae Kim, who plays Zuko and Azula’s ruthless father, Fire Lord Ozai,told Tudum. \"And they really did a good job of that with that cliff-hanger and also created a sense of urgency and time.\"What's next for Zuko (center) and his allies?(Image credit: Netflix)There’s also the escalating tension between Zuko and Azula as they continue their complicated family dynamic. Azula took the city of Omashu and its King Bumi captive, while an injured Zuko fled from the battle in the North. Zuko is one of the most fascinating characters inAvatar: The Last Airbenderand, while long-time fans know what lies in store for him in future seasons, it'll be no less intriguing to see him evolve as an individual.And what of Aang’s face-to-face with the aforementioned pair's father and ruler of the Fire Nation, Fire Lord Ozai?\"Always leave the audience wanting more,\" Lee teased. \"I just had chills seeing Lizzy as Azula. You’ve got King Bumi in shackles, and it’s just like, ‘Oh, there’s so many cliff-hangers.’ I was like, ‘Oh, I want to shoot season 2 [and] 3 right now.'\"Unfortunately for Kim, he hasn't done that, with Boylan and Rassani assuming the reins as co-showrunners. It'll be equally interesting, then, to see if Avatar: The Last Airbender seasons 2 and 3 are better (or worse) than what's come before. Speaking of the show's third season...Has Avatar: The Last Airbender been renewed for a third season?That’s a wrap on Avatar: The Last Airbender Season 2!The time of Sozin’s comet draws near. Season 3 is now in production! pic.twitter.com/Esx3ZOOGAqMay 20, 2025It has. As we mentioned earlier, Netflix renewedAvatar: The Last Airbenderfor two more seasons last March. As the above X/Twitter post reveals, season 3 has entered full production as of May 2025, too.With season 2 taking around six months to film, its sequel could take a similar amount of time. If that's the case, principal photography could wrap on the series' final installment before the end of 2025. That could allow Netflix to release seasons 2 and 3 within close proximity of one another, or ensure season 3 arrives no later than a year afterAvatarseason 2's launch. In short: Avatar: The Last Airbender could be done and dusted as a Netflix TV Original by the end of 2026.For more Netflix TV-based coverage, read our guides onOne Pieceseason 2,Stranger Thingsseason 5,Wednesdayseason 2, andSquid Gameseason 3.Grace DeanContributorGrace is a freelance writer for TechRadar, with past work at sites like GamesRadar, Metro and WhatToWatch.

Yet neither economic theory nor the data support such exuberant forecasts.BOSTON – According to tech leaders and many pundits and academics, artificial intelligence is poised to transform the world as we know it through unprecedented productivity gains. While some believe that machines soon will doeverythinghumans can do, ushering in a new age of boundless prosperity, other predictions are at least more grounded. For example, Goldman Sachspredictsthat generative AI will boost global GDP by 7% over the next decade, and the McKinsey Global Instituteanticipatesthat the annual GDP growth rate could increase by 3-4 percentage points between now and 2040. For its part,The Economistexpects that AI will create ablue-collar bonanza.Is this realistic? As I note in arecent paper, the outlook is far more uncertain than most forecasts and guesstimates suggest. Still, while it is basically impossible to predict with any confidence what AI will do in 20 or 30 years, one can say something about the next decade, because most of these near-term economic effects must involve existing technologies and improvements to them.It is reasonable to suppose that AI’s biggest impact will come from automating some tasks and making some workers in some occupations more productive. Economic theory provides some guidance for assessing these aggregate effects. According toHulten’s theorem(named for economist Charles Hulten), aggregate “total factor productivity” (TFP) effects are simply the product of the share of tasks that are automated multiplied by the average cost savings.While average cost savings are difficult to estimate and will vary by activity, there have already been some careful studies of AI’s effects on certain tasks. For example, Shakked Noy and Whitney Zhang haveexamined the impact of ChatGPTon simple writing tasks (such as summarizing documents or writing routine grant proposals or marketing material), whileErik Brynjolfsson, Danielle Li, and Lindsey Raymond haveassessedthe use of AI assistants in customer service. Taken together, this research suggests that currently available generative-AI tools yield average labor-cost savings of 27% and overall cost savings of 14.4%.What about the share of tasks that will be affected by AI and related technologies? Using numbers fromrecent studies, I estimate this to be around 4.6%, implying that AI will increase TFP by only 0.66% over ten years, or by 0.06% annually. Of course, since AI will also drive an investment boom, the increase in GDP growth could be a little larger, perhaps in the 1-1.5% range.These figures are much smaller than the ones from Goldman Sachs and McKinsey. If you want to get those bigger numbers, you either must boost the productivity gains at the micro level or assume that many more tasks in the economy will be affected. But neither scenario seems plausible. Labor-cost savings far above 27% not only fall out of the range offered by existing studies; they also do not align with the observed effects of other, even more promising technologies. For example, industrial robots have transformed some manufacturing sectors, and they appear to have reduced labor costs byabout 30%.Introducing Project Syndicate’s Forward Thinkers ListIntroducing Project Syndicate’s Forward Thinkers ListOur Forward Thinkers list recognizes and spotlights intellectual innovators poised to shape international debates in the years ahead. It brings together 30 influential individuals from academia, policymaking, civil society, and the private sector — voices challenging conventional wisdom and blazing a new path.Meet the Forward ThinkersSimilarly, we are unlikely to see far more than 4.6% of tasks being taken over, because AI is nowhere close to being able to perform most manual or social tasks (including seemingly simple functions with some social aspects, like accounting). As of 2019, asurveyof essentially all US businesses found that only about 1.5% of them had any AI investments. Even if such investments have picked up over the past year and a half, we have a long, long way to go before AI becomes widespread.Of course, AI could have larger effects than my analysis allows if it revolutionizes the process of scientific discovery or creates many new tasks and products. The recent AI-enabled discoveries of newcrystal structuresand advances inprotein foldingdo suggest such possibilities. But these breakthroughs are unlikely to be a major source of economic growth within ten years. Even if new discoveries could be tested and turned into actual products much faster, the tech industry is currentlyfocused excessivelyon automation and monetizing data, rather than on introducing new production tasks for workers.Moreover, my own estimates could be too high. Early adoption of generative AI has naturally occurred where it performs reasonably well, meaning tasks for which there are objective measures of success, such as writing simple programming subroutines or verifying information. Here, the model can learn on the basis of outside information and readily available historical data.But many of the 4.6% of tasks that could feasibly be automated within ten years – evaluating applications, diagnosing health problems, providing financial advice – do not have such clearly defined objective measures of success, and often involve complex context-dependent variables (what is good for one patient will not be right for another). In these cases, learning from outside observation is much harder, and generative AI models must rely instead on the behavior of existing workers.Under these circumstances, there will be less room for major improvements over human labor. Thus, I estimate that about one-quarter of the 4.6% tasks are of the “harder-to-learn” category and will have lower productivity gains. Once this adjustment is made, the 0.66% TFP growth figure declines to about 0.53%.What about the effects on workers, wages, and inequality? The good news is that, compared to earlier waves of automation – such as those based on robots or software systems – the effects of AI may be more broadly distributed across demographic groups. If so, it will not have as extensive an impact on inequality as earlier automation technologies did (I estimated these effects in myprevious workwithPascual Restrepo). However, I find no evidence that AI willreduceinequality or boost wage growth. Some groups – especially white, native-born women – are significantly more exposed and will be negatively affected, and capital will gain more than labor overall.Economic theory and the available data justify a more modest, realistic outlook for AI. There is little to support theargumentthat we should not worry about regulation, because AI will be the proverbial rising tide that lifts all boats. AI is what economists call a general-purpose technology. We can do many things with it, and there are certainly better things to do than automate work and boost the profitability of digital advertising. But if we embrace techno-optimism uncritically or let the tech industry set the agenda, much of the potential could be squandered.FeaturedUS Fiscal Irresponsibility Is Everyone’s ProblemThe Tragedy of Emmanuel MacronSouth Korea Is Facing a Triple ChallengeThe Case for Militant DemocracyWestern Businesses Will Not Return to RussiaLicensing2Contact UsLicensinghttps://prosyn.org/YxSIjSQ",

    "content": "The 3 Gurus of 90s Web Design: Zeldman, Siegel, NielsenWith the rise of Flash and CSS in 1997, three web design philosophies emerged. David Siegel advocated for 'hacks', Jakob Nielsen kept it simple, while Jeffrey Zeldman combined flair with usability.ByRichard MacManus|May 28, 2025| Tags:Dot-com,1997My well-thumbed copies of three classic web design books: 'Creating Killer Web Sites' by David Siegel (1996-97), 'Taking your Talent to the Web' by Jeffrey Zeldman (2001), and 'Designing Web Usability' by Jakob Nielsen (1999).Like many of the first wave of web designers, Jeffrey Zeldman — who turned 42 in early 1997 — had begun his career in a completely different profession. He’d started out as an aspiring fiction author, briefly worked as a journalist, tried his hand as a touring musician, and then spent ten years in the advertising business. “Writing billboards and coming up with quick visuals was good training for the web because you have to communicate something instantly,” helater saidin an interview.It was therise of multimediathat attracted creatives like Zeldman, who made his first website in 1995. “Hyperlinked text made the web, graphics made it a consumer playground,”he wroteon his personal website at the end of 1996.Jeffrey Zeldman's homepage, March 1997. Note that the typical display size at the time was 800x600 pixels, so this and other websites would likely have been designed for those dimensions.Via Wayback Machine.But if the web was a “consumer playground” now, it was still one with many constraints. As Zeldman told budding web designers, “the accepted wisdom is to use as few images as possible, and make them as small as you can (small in file size, though not necessarily in height or width).”To create his webpages,Zeldman useda plain text editor on a Macintosh computer to compose the HTML, along with Photoshop to create his graphics. He encouraged people to keep to HTML fundamentals, but he was also pragmatic — copy other designers to learn, he advised, and select “File: View Source” to see how different pages on the web were created.\"Imitation is the sincerest form of theft, and most every web author starts by stealing.\" From an FAQ on Zeldman's site, March 1997;via Wayback Machine.The 3 MusketeersEarly in his new career as a web designer, Zeldman was heavily influenced by David Siegel, who had published a book in 1996 entitledCreating Killer Web Sites: The Art of Third-Generation Site Design. This was beforeCSS (Cascading Style Sheets) or Flash, so the book advocated for “hacks” to HTML in order to make websites more visually appealing. The primary hacks were using invisible tables and single-pixel GIFs to help control layout. The book had a chapter entitled “A PDF Primer,” but did not mention CSS (as the final spec hadn’t yet been released). The second edition, published in 1997, replaced the PDF primer with a new chapter: “A CSS Primer.” That’s how fast web design was changing at this time.David Siegel's homepage, February 1997;via Wayback Machine.Siegel was around 37 years old at the start of 1997, but unlike Zeldman he had a background in digital design. He’d started his career in digital typography and so when he moved to the web, his goal was purely aesthetic. “I will use any means necessary to achieve quality typography and clear communication,”he wroteon his website. One of the ways he chose to do this was to focus his efforts onNetscape Navigator. “I will not make pages that are optimized for ALL browsers,” he wrote.This was the beginning of browser optimization on the web, which forced web users to view certain websites in a specific browser. Siegel styled himself as an “HTML terrorist,” so he was willing to take a contrary stance to achieve perfect typography on the web.David Siegel's \"Web Wonk\" HTML tips site, February 1997;via Wayback Machine.If Siegel was a self-described web design terrorist, then 39-year old Jakob Nielsen positioned himself as a web sheriff.He wrotethat his goal was to “get rid of superficial coolness and make websites into serious business tools.” He wasn’t a trained designer (instead, hecalled himselfa “usability guru”), but Nielsen strongly advocated for designs that were accessible on all the main browsers. For this reason he encouraged designers to use “semantic encoding” to keep content and presentation separate.At first, Nielsen was talking about sticking to the structure defined in the HTML specification — such as using H1 and H2 for headers, rather than encoding something like \"18 pixels tall bold Garamond.” Essentially, he was saying that each browser should define how headers would be displayed to their users. But he quickly got behind the emerging web standard, CSS. “Style sheets are a new development on the Web and currently not widely used,”wrote Nielsenat the end of 1996, “but they are the only solution to getting nice presentation with ever-increasing numbers of browsers and display devices.”Jakob Nielsen's Useit website, February 1997;via Wayback Machine.The problem was, CSS support from the two main browsers at the start of 1997 waspatchy at best. Internet Explorer 3.0 was the closest to supporting the W3C standard for CSS, but it wasbuggy and inconsistent. As for Netscape, its 3.0 browser hadpoor CSS support. In fact, the company even tried to create an alternative to CSS, with a JavaScript-powered styling mechanism called JavaScript-Based Style Sheets (JSSS). Thankfully JSSS went nowhere, but it did serve to delay Netscape getting behind the nascent web standard for style sheets.As 1997 progressed, the schism between the aesthetic approach to web design (personified by Siegel) and the semantic approach (personified by Nielsen) widened. Jeffrey Zeldman found himself in the middle of this. He was a proponent of CSS, but he also wasn’t above using new tools that disregarded semantic coding — like Shockwave and Flash. Over the coming years, Zeldman continued to insist that web design could be both aesthetic and standards-compliant. “Images, table layouts, style sheets, JavaScript, server-side technologies like PHP, and embedded technologies like Flash and Quicktime are all compatible with the rigors of accessible site design,”he wroteas late as July 2002.Flash PointZeldman would eventually turn his back on Flash, which of all the web design tools available in the 90s was probably the least semantic. But when it first became popular, over 1997, it was seen as an animation tool that could take multimedia on the web to the next level.In May 1997, Macromediareleased Flash 2, \"the first tool for creating and animating vector-based resolution-independent graphics without programming\";image via Web Design Museum.Flash had a few important things going for it. Firstly, the tool was easy to learn (unlike CSS). Secondly, it could do much more, visually, than CSS at that time. Almost anything was possible using Flash, with the only constraint being bandwidth limitations. Thirdly, and most crucially, Flash didn’t rely on the leading browser companies implementing it. The Flash player was a browser plug-in, so all it needed was for users to download that plug-in. Which they did, en masse.Siegel quickly embraced Flash. In the second edition ofCreating Killer Websites, published in September 1997,he wrotethat “Flash is the best bet for bringing vector graphics into mainstream use on the Web.” To be fair, he also devoted an entire new chapter to CSS. However, he clearly wasn’t impressed by what CSS could actually deliver at the time. “To a certain extent, this chapter represents an exercise in futility — it demonstrates the appalling degree to which the browsers fail to deliver on the promise of style sheets in August 1997,” he wrote. In his summary, he expressed hope for CSS, but warned that “I will continue to commit HTML terrorism to accomplish my design objectives on today’s browsers.”The Flash section of the second edition of Killer Websites; via Internet Archive.As quickly as Siegel and Zeldman embraced Flash, Nielsen just as quickly rejected it — primarily because presentation and content were mashed together into one file, so there was nothing at all semantic about the code it produced. A few years later, hefamously wrotethat Flash was “99% bad” and that it was almost always “a usability disease.”Even Siegel was concerned that Flash was a proprietary tool, owned and controlled by Macromedia (which hadacquired the technologyfrom a company called FutureWave at the end of 1996). Flash couldn’t have been more different from CSS — the software was not open source, the file format (.fla) was proprietary, and the output did not conform to web standards.The W3C Style page, June 1997;via Wayback Machine.For all their differences, CSS and Flash did have similar goals: both aimed to expand the state of web design on the web. Yet only one of them led to an explosion of visual creativity on the web over the rest of the 1990s…and it wasn’t the open web standard. If you wanted to create a killer website in 1997, Flash was the tool many web designers of that time reached for.Whatever Happened To…As for Zeldman, Siegel and Nielsen, for alltheir differences, the three musketeers of web design all wanted to move their fledgling profession forward. Because the web platform was in flux in 1997 — epitomised by the emergence of Flash and CSS, two diametrically opposed technologies — web design was necessarily experimental that year.It’s only by looking at the careers of all three men in the following decades that you get a sense of which web design philosophy eventually ‘won’.Post-90s, Jakob Nielsen became ever more defined by his barebones website, Useit, which eschewed any design flourishes. Like Craigslist, another famously minimalist website, Useit didn't change its design over the years. By the Web 2.0 period, it was seen my most in the web design profession as beinghopelessly outdated. The site lasted several more years, before Nielsen announced that Useit would befolded intohis main corporate website, NNGroup, at the end of 2012.It may not surprise you to know that in 2025, Jakob Nielsen is writingabout AI on Substack.Useit website in December 2012, just before it was closed down. The design (purposefully) hadn't changed much since 1997.via Wayback Machine.David Siegel has had a surprisingly varied career. He was the most qualified design professional of the three, having earned a master's degree in digital typography from Stanford University in 1985 and then working at Pixar. But after two editions of his hugely influential “Killer Web Sites” book over 1996-97, he switched gears and moved from web design to web business in the late-90s. I hadsome contactwith him in 2010, when he was promoting his fourth book,Pull: The Power of the Semantic Web to Transform Your Business.Later, Siegel got interested in the blockchain and pursued that for a few years. His current website, cuttingthroughthenoise.net, shows that he now has a variety of business and personal interests.David Siegel's website in 2025reflects his eclectic interests.Jeffrey Zeldman is still very much a web designer. Since 2019 he’s been Executive Creative Director at Automattic, the company behind the WordPress blogging system, Tumblr, and other web products. He still regularly blogs about web design topics on his website,zeldman.com— although the current site design is one of the default WordPress themes.I was curious why he no longer has a custom design, so before I published this article I reached out to him via a Bluesky DM. He replied: \"I'm working on a redesign of my site as we speak. It will go live soon.\" He added that the default WordPress theme, which he switched to in February 2019, \"wasn't so different from one I might have designed myself at the time. That said, after living with the default theme for six years, I'm ready to move on.\"Jeffrey Zeldman's website as at 28 May 2025...but stay tuned, a redesign is coming soon!I must say, I'm thrilled to hear that Zeldman is working on a redesign. I'd argue that his pragmatic approach to web design — combining web standards with design flair — was what won out during the 90s and early 2000s. Certainly, of the three web design gurus in 1997, Zeldman’s website back then was by far the most interesting and exotic. So I look forward to seeing that design philosophy return to zeldman.com — and indeed, let's hope it proliferates again across the rest of the indie web.A sneaky pic of metaken by Jeffrey Zeldmanin June 2010, during one of my trips to NYC.Cybercultural is a website about internet history and its impact on our culture.

However, during the development process, I encountered limitations with GPT-3's ability to fully automate this task.As a result, I shifted to traditional code generation methods to complete the SDK, ensuring a more robust and reliable tool. Despite this change in approach, both GitHub Copilot and GPT-3 were instrumental in accelerating the development process, providing valuable insights and saving significant time.I would also like to extend my gratitude to theffmpeg-pythonproject, which inspired this project significantly. The API style and design ideas fromffmpeg-pythonhave been influential, and I have utilized these aspects to shape the development of our SDK.This project is dedicated to my son, Austin, on his seventh birthday (February 24, 2024), whose curiosity and zest for life continually inspire me.Feel free to check theDocumentationfor detailed information and more advanced features.",

    "content": "This blog is inspired by Jordan Tigani’s blog titled“Big Data is Dead”. Jordan and I actually spent some time building a HTAP database at SingleStore.The good old days ('70s)Back in the ’70s, one relational database did everything. Transactions (OLTP) during the day and reports after hours (OLAP). Databases like Oracle V2 and IBM DB2 ran OLTP and OLAP on the same system; largely because data sets still fit on a few disks and compute was costly.Nobody called it Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP); it was simply thedatabase.The great divide (‘80s)As businesses had more data and asked tougher questions, the database began to show its limits.See, transactional and analytical workloads pull in opposite directions. OLTP requires microsecond inserts and single-row lookups, while OLAP demands full-table scans and large-scale aggregates. This created constant contention; analytics consuming I/O and cache needed for latency-sensitive transactions, and vice versa.The solution? Isolate the workloads. By the early ’80s, the Great Divide had begun.The storage split (‘90s)A key technical driver behind this divide was storage architecture. OLTP systems optimized for row-based storage (fast writes + point queries). While OLAP systems chose columnar storage for efficient scans and aggregations.By the mid-2000s, this split had become industry standard. Database pioneer Michael Stonebraker marked this shift in hispaper, “One Size Fits All”: An Idea Whose Time Has Come and Gone. The database started breaking up into specialized engines.OLTP and OLAP both ditched the SQL (2000–2010s)Horizontal scaling pushed OLTP and OLAP even further apart.Early distributed OLTP databases (NoSQL engines like MongoDB) dropped SQL and analytical capabilities entirely. On the analytics side, we saw the adoption of MapReduce and Data Lake architectures (Hadoop/HDFS): trading traditional RDBMS properties like strict consistency for massive throughput.The unexpected reconciliation (2010s)In the 2010s, two distinct database movements gained momentum:1.NewSQL(Spanner, CockroachDB, Vitess). OLTP should remain SQL-based.2.Cloud Data Warehouses(Redshift, Snowflake). OLAP should be on SQL systems with stronger consistency guarantees.On paper, these systems served very different workloads. But under the hood, they shared a lot: distributed, MPP-style execution, and SQL. OLTP and OLAP systems, in isolation, had converged on many of the same architectural principles. There was one big difference: storage engines.We asked ourselves: what if you could combine both row and columnstore storage engines in a single database?Voilà, HTAP (2014)In 2014, Gartnerintroducedthe term HTAP (Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing): the next big DB architecture.The goal was to close the gap between operational and analytical systems. This was a necessity for emerging workloads like pricing, fraud detection, and personalization. Even at the business level, decision makers wanted now’s data. Early HTAP systems showed it could be done. Well, mostly…SingleStoreDBcombined an in-memory rowstore, a disk-based columnstore, and a vectorized execution engine—supporting fast scans, seeks, filters, aggregations, and updates in a single system. Over time, we found that with modern hardware, the columnstore alone could handle a surprising number of OLTP-style queries, including point lookups and low-latency access patterns.TiDBtook a different route, pairing its TiKV rowstore with a separate columnar engine based on ClickHouse—maintaining two copies of the data to serve both workloads.So that should be it, right? ‘70s data nirvana, alas.The Cloud Data Warehouse was the only winner (2020s)Cloud data warehouses have clearly won. The NewSQL movement stalled… And HTAP? It never got the attention it deserved. Despite real technical progress, it remained pre-product market fit.1. It’s really, really hard to replace someone’s OLTP system.TakeDBEngines’word for this: Oracle and SQL Server still sit at #1 and #3.2. Most workloads don’t need distributed OLTP.Hardware got faster and cheaper. A single beefy machine can handle the majority of transactional workloads.CursorandOpenAIare powered by a single-box Postgres instance. You’ll be just fine.3. Cloud-native architectures favored shared-disk, not shared-nothing.While NewSQL systems demanded fast local storage (and even in-memory durability), cloud platforms pushed toward object storage and elastic compute.4. OLTP and OLAP are owned by different teams.OLTP is owned by product engineering; OLAP belongs to the data team. The incentives rarely align. No one gets promoted for “consolidating the stack”.Your data-stack forms the HTAP database (Today)The cloud also started the move away from tightly coupled warehouses toward modular lakes built on object storage.In trying to escape the traditional warehouse/database, data teams started assembling their own custom systems. Made of ‘best-in-class’ building blocks:1. OLTP systems and stream processors as the WAL2. Open table formats like Iceberg serve as the storage engine3. Query engines like Spark and Trino for execution4. Real-time systems like ClickHouse or Elastic function as indexesEven in today’s disaggregated data stack, the need remains the same: fast OLAP queries on fresh transactional data. This now happens through a web of streaming pipelines, cloud data lakes, and real-time query layers.It’s still HTAP; but through composition instead of consolidation of databases. It comes down to questions like:1. How do I apply the WAL to my storage engine?AKA: How do I CDC from my OLTP system to the data lake efficiently?2. Can I build a lower-cost index on my data lake, and keep it in sync?AKA: How do I ingest real-time data into the lake? Or how do I query Lake data with Postgres or Elastic functionality?The HTAP challenge of our time comes down to making the lakehouse real-time ready.After spending my best 10 years first starting and then rescuing it, HTAP as a database is dead.But let the spirit live on.🥮",

    "content": "Share this postPretty Good BlogWhat Threads Are, Part 2Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreWhat Threads Are, Part 2They're Mario Bros. for the NES, apparently.May 27, 20252Share this postPretty Good BlogWhat Threads Are, Part 2Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMore5ShareThis is another post about programming, which I almost never write about.Click hereto jump straight to trying this thing out for yourself.In myprevious poston Threads, I made an offhand comparison1:Threads2are just emulator3save states4, coupled with a condition upon which they will be resumed.At the time, I thought this aprettyokayanalogy — but I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I’ve been turning it around in my mind for a while. I think it has serious untapped potential as a pedagogical tool.So I added multithreading toSuper Mario Bros.for the NES.The Thing ItselfNo buried ledes here.What It IsI should explain myself.What you just watched happens to be a multithreaded NES emulation, withSuper Mario Bros.as the threads.There are three “threads” running, each a distinct instance of the game. Every so often, the emulator switches “threads”, swapping to a different instance of the game.Each “thread” is assigned a different color palette, which we apply when we resume said thread. This is why the colors are constantly changing around in the video.More Specifically…When World 1-1 starts, the “multithreading” begins. Specifically, my script creates threesave states, each representing the current state of the game5. Then I create threethreads6, and give them their respective save state to hold on to.Then I start the thread scheduler.The thread scheduler’s job is simple:Every 160 frames, switch to a new threadThe next thread ideally, in a rotating fashion (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, …)Skip over threads which areKILLED,BLOCKED(unless they can be unblocked), orSLEEPING(unless it’s time to wake them)To switch to a new thread:First, update thecurrentthread’s save state with the current game stateThen, load in thenewthread’s save stateFinally, update thegame color paletteto reflect which thread we’re onThis covers what you see for the first bit of the video: each thread starts at the same time (the loading screen for World 1-1), with different “games” being swapped in every so often.Essentially,three different games of Mario Bros.are being played “at the same time”, but only one is actuallyactiveat any given time.Beyond Just Time SlicingThis image shows the full World 1-1 map, with color-coded areas indicating various features explained below. I recommend clicking to expand this image.Time slicing is cool — we’re running three “concurrent” games of Mario! — but that’s far from the only threading concept demonstrated here.I’ve set up the game world in such a way that certain areas or features activate synchronization primitives (such as a mutex); you canphysically interact with threading boundaries.I describe the synchronization primitives I’ve set up below, but thenet effectis:If a Mario is standing on the three blocks at the start of the level, no other Mario’s game will run until he leaves (Disabled Interrupts)Only one Mario can be inside the Pipe Sub-level at a time (Mutex)If a Mario enters while another Mario is inside, his game will not resume until the other Mario leavesOnce a Mario touches the flagpole, his game pauses until all the other Marios have touched their flagpoles (Condition Variables)Disabled InterruptsThe red shaded area on the map denotes a section of the world whereinterrupts are disabled, and therefore, the thread scheduler cannot run.Whenever a Mario enters the red shaded area, his thread won’t lose control until he leaves the area, regardless of what other Marios are doing.MutexesThe yellow shaded area (difficult to discern — it’s the fourth pipe from the left; the one you can go down) demonstrates amutex: an area of the game world where only one Mario may exist at a time.When a Mario goes down the pipe, he tries to acquire thepipeMutex. If nothing else owns that mutex (i.e., no other thread is currently in the pipe sub-level), then he immediately gains ownership of the mutex and proceeds without issue.However, if another Mario owns the mutex (is presently in the pipe sub-level), then the Mario which is presently entering the pipe will beblockeduntil the mutex is released (the other Mario leaves the pipe sub-level).Marios outside of the pipe sub-level are not blocked, and are still allowed to run.Condition VariablesThe green shaded area (the flagpole at the end of the level) demonstrates acondition variable: when a Mario touches the flagpole, he incrementsnumMariosTouchedFlagpole— a “condition variable” — by 1, and then blocks until that same condition variable is equal to the number of threads. In other words, he waits until all the other Marios have touched the flagpole before continuing.SleepWhenever a Mario kills an enemy, his thread goes to sleep for 300 frames.It’s hard to tell in the video, but a thread that goes to sleepdoesn’t necessarily come back on time; it has to wait until the thread scheduler nextdecidesto run it.What’s The Point?First of all, it’s incredibly coolThis actuallyisthreads.We have taken a machine — cursed with an inability7to do more than one thing at a time — and added concurrency to it, without modifying thecore engine(or CPU) to have any notion of “threads”.We added threads to this emulatorin the same waythat we add threads to normal CPUs: we take clever advantage of a mechanism which allows us to A) save the current state of the machine and B) load it back up in the future if and when we choose. All without the emulatoritselfever being designed for, or having any notion of, “threads”.Andyou can touch it.You interact with these bona fide threads not through a debugger, not by instantiating a Mutex, but bywalking into a critical sectionand observing how the threading behavior changes in real time.It’s sick!But mainly, I want to kill mystificationHas anyone seen it? Do you know where it lives? What time does it tend to come home?I want more people to understand the things that “nobody understands.” Not because we will imminently need them; but becausethere is certain joy and immense value in conquering these things anyways.If you’re getting into software today, you are liable to be thrown right into the middle of the abstraction wilderness. One can spenddecadesin these lands: learning new frameworks; adopting new stacks; exploring endlessly in all directions but into the mysteriousdown.No need to go down there. Nobody knows what’s beyond that barrier.But the concrete has not cured8. We do not have the luxury of treating these layers as bedrock:don’t even bother trying to get in. Just trust that it’ll hold your house up. Oh, we’ve built the house — this trillion-dollar industry of a house — and sure, it’s standing. But when the foundation fails, what use is the house? When the foundation must evolve, how will we contribute to that process, knowing only how to build atop it? How could we accurately judge a new foundation, knowing nothing about how the old one was built?Threads are not very complicated, and I don’t think I’m particularly smart for knowing how they work. Simple circumstance forced me to work with them at a deep level, which one cannot do without gaining an understanding of the thing. Anyone who had to work with them in the same way I did would likely have the same level of understanding. Conversely, there are countless things I’ve never worked with — and thus do not understand — which I certainlyshouldknow more about.Whatiscomplicated is how to make threads workextremely efficientlyand reliably. Switching contexts? Not too hard. Optimizing the hell out of them with data structures and algorithms? My intuition usually fails me on this front — I am no CS guru. But the core innovation of threads requires none of this.That’s the case for almost everything of this sort: these are all relatively simple ideas! Taking the time to understand them only requires understandingstructureandlogical flow; one does not need to dive into complex math or advanced algorithms in order to grasp theroot idea. And once it’s been grasped, we can add it to our foundational understanding; a new bone in the ol’ conceptual skeleton; supercharging workway up the stackin ways we cannot predict.Learning frontend frameworks is useful. One can produce billions of dollars from such work! But nothing will give you an understanding offrontend frameworks as a conceptlike creating your own framework9. Once you’ve done that, the way you perceive and grok any other framework will be permanently enhanced.Before I built this, I would have struggled to talk about how to implement a mutex — I’ve never done it before! My implementation is certainly terrible; a naive, simplistic approach which works only because the stakes are so low. But that’s fine:I can see the next steps. The ways in which it could improve. Through working on this — even throughidentifying problems I want to avoid solving— my brain is building pathways and forging connections between concepts without my knowledge.I don’t know how the Linux kernel implements mutexes, or the best way to implement them in a battle-hardened system; it’d be silly to say that building this toy would grant me such expertise. But I now know how to evaluate what I’m looking at if I have to. “Damn, they built it way better than I did” is a far more instructive, useful experience than “damn, they built a thing I have no understanding of!”How It Got DoneAt first, I was going to find an open-source NES emulator and add all this directly into its source code. This was going to be quite cool and impressive of me. Then I foundFCEUX, which exposes a Lua plugin system through which I can do everything I need. Jackpot.I do still want the credit for the original plan, though.Afew hundred lines of Lualater, and we have a legitimate thread scheduler, with support for mutexes, condition variables, interrupt masking, sleep, and more.I highly encourage you to read the code for yourself, but I’ll walk through some of it here.0. Getting our claws inBefore we build a thread scheduler, we need to be comfortable in our environment. We’re writing a Lua plugin for an NES emulator… what can we do?Luckily, thedocumentationis quite helpful — already, we can see that we have the tools we need to:Create a save state (savestate.create()andsavestate.save())This is how we’ll “save” a thread so we can resume it laterLoad a save state (savestate.load())This is how we’ll resume a thread we previously put to sleepRead memory from the game’s RAM (memory.readbyte())This is how we’ll figure out what level the player is on, their coordinates within the level, etc.We’ll usethis helpful documentto figure out where all the juicy bits live in the game’s RAMDraw text on the screen (gui.drawtext())This is how we’ll obscure the majority of the screen with irrelevant informationControl when frames get executed on the emulator (emu.frameadvance())Our lua code needs to call this function whenever a frame of the game should runThis lets us do anything we wantin-between framesThis is everything we need!Let’s start with a basic “do-nothing” script, which is functionally identical to no script at all:while true do emu.advanceframe() end1. Detect that the player has startedWe want to only kick in and start multithreading once the player has started the game.I don’t have the best solution here, but I decided to hook into theGAME_MODE(0x0770) andPRE_LEVEL_SCREEN_SHOWING(0x0757) memory addresses. When each has the value of1, we know that the game is starting and is showing the “pre-level screen”, which is a good place to start in my opinion.This is what that looks like:function initiate() emu.frameadvance() if not emu.emulating() then return end local gameMode = memory.readbyte(0x0770) local preLevelScreen = memory.readbyte(0x0757) if gameMode ~= 1 or preLevelScreen ~= 1 then return end initiated = true end function loop() emu.frameadvance() end while true do if not initiated then initiate() else loop() end endThis works, but doesn’tdoanything yet.2. Begin multithreadingNow that we can detect when the game has begun, we can start implementing threads.Remember:threads are just snapshots of state, combined with a condition upon which they should be resumed.For now, we’ll ignore the “condition to resume” part. We’ll focus solely on the time-slicing bits.So, we’ll need:A list of threadsEach of which has:An IDA save stateA notion of the “current thread”A way to switch from the “current thread” to some other threadA timer which tracks when we should switch threadsHere’s the full implementation for just time slicing:THREAD_SWITCH_FREQUENCY = 100 NUM_THREADS = 3 local threads = {} local curThreadIndex = nil local curFrame = 0 local lastSwitchedThreads = 0 local initiated = false function shouldRunScheduler() return (curFrame - lastSwitchedThreads) >= THREAD_SWITCH_FREQUENCY end function threadScheduler() local newThreadIndex = curThreadIndex + 1 if newThreadIndex > NUM_THREADS then newThreadIndex = 1 end local oldThread = threads[curThreadIndex] local newThread = threads[newThreadIndex] savestate.save(oldThread.saveState) savestate.load(newThread.saveState) curThreadIndex = newThreadIndex end function initiate() emu.frameadvance() if not emu.emulating() then return end local gameMode = memory.readbyte(0x0770) local preLevelScreen = memory.readbyte(0x0757) if gameMode ~= 1 or preLevelScreen ~= 1 then return end for i = 1, NUM_THREADS do local thread = {} thread.id = i thread.saveState = savestate.create() savestate.save(thread.saveState) table.insert(threads, thread) end initiated = true curThreadIndex = 1 threadScheduler() end function loop() emu.frameadvance() if shouldRunScheduler() then threadScheduler() lastSwitchedThreads = curFrame end end while true do curFrame = curFrame + 1 if not initiated then initiate() else loop() end endThis works! Start World 1-1, and you’ll start switching between 3 threads, ruining the gameplay experience in its entirety.3. Code the rest of the thread schedulerI think this is a good place to stop with the implementation details.Now that you have a function which can switch threads on demand, it’s not too hard to add:Thread prioritiesSleepingLocking on resources (mutexes, semaphores, etc.)Whatever your heart desires!I encourage you to try out the full code — linked above — for yourself!How to try itFirst, obtain a legal copy of a Super Mario Bros. ROM for the NES. I offer no assistance on this front.Second, downloadFCEUX10. Click that blog link and download that unsigned executable. Do it.Third, download theLua scriptand save it somewhere you can find on your computer.Fourth,read the Lua script and ensure I didn’t just trick you into downloading malware.Fifth, open FCEUX. ClickFile → Load Lua Script. ClickBrowse, then find the Lua file you saved. HitLoadand thenStart.Sixth, clickFile → Open ROM. Find the ROM file you downloaded.Seventh, play the game. You might want to configure controls inOptions → Input Config.Eighth, realize that constantly switching between three instances ofSuper Mario Bros.isn’t pleasant, and you had no good reason to think it would be.More Of ItDeadlocksI haven’t actually set up a situation in which a true deadlock (A holds X, B holds Y, A tries to get Y while B tries to get X) can occur, but it would be handled (in a primitive manner) by the thread scheduler.Whenever there is no thread thatcanbe run (as would be the case in a deadlock, or if all threads are dead, or if all threads are asleep11), the thread scheduler will halt the game and show an error message.One deadlock-ish way this can happen is if every Mario is waiting on the mutex to enter the pipe, and then the Marioinsidethe pipe dies. This is really a dangling mutex, but let’s call it a deadlock.(It’s hard to tell in this video, because the ‘on death’ trigger occurs before the animation even plays, but the Mario inside the pipe dies and thus leaves a dangling mutex)“True” ConcurrencyWhat if the thread scheduler runs much more often?WARNING: I think this video could legitimately induce an epileptic seizure.I don’t like it.ConclusionThis is not a good thread scheduler.It does not support thread priorities; idle tasks; semaphores; fairness algorithms; dynamic thread spawning and joining; tracking mutex wait lists; making me any money. It is horribly inefficient, and very annoying to play with. But I love it.I love it because I was able to build something — which I at one time presumed to be magic — in roughly 300 lines of Lua. I had never done this before! But here it is: my very own thread scheduler, in the most ridiculous of environments. Maybe this will be my DOOM thing: turning every video game into threads. Probably not.It’s one of those projects that delights at every turn. How utterly wild it was to see it working the first time! Honestly, part of me didn’t expect that it would ever work.I hope this taught you about… threads, was it?1I also made a bunch of promises about what the next post would be about. Sorry: promises broken.2As in multithreading. As in hyperthreading. As inomegathreading. You get the gist.3Emulators, in this context, are programs which allow you to play console games (NES, SNES, GameBoy, Xbox, PlayStation, etc.) on a computer.They do this byemulating(my god…) the hardware of the console, doing a whole bunch of complicated shit to make it all work.4In an emulator (such as the one I’m using to play the NES gameSuper Mario Bros.), asave stateis a file which contains a copy of the emulated console’s memory, CPU registers, etc.Once a save state has been created, it can beloadedat any point in the future, bringing the game to theexact state it was inwhen the save state was created.For example, you could create a save state right before your character makes a move; perform your move; and then load the save state if the outcome was unfavorable. Your game will continue as if you never even made the move.5Because all three save states are created at the same time, they all store the same initial game state.6In this context, a “thread” is a very simple Lua object that my code creates.I am not creating a real Operating System thread; I am creating athread data structure, similar to the data structure thatyour OS createswhen you “create a thread.” This isn’t just a thin wrapper around OS threads; this isreally implementing threads from the ground up.7Refusal?8I’ve been toying with this idea — “the concrete hasn’t cured” — for a while, and perhaps it’s fitting that it gets expanded on in this footnote.We’ve built too greedily and too high, and have relegated certain knowledge — knowledge which wecertainly should not forgetas modern professionals — to the mystic realms, assuring ourselves we don’t need to know about it. This is incorrect.There are some layers with which we should not concern ourselves: it isperfectly acceptableto not know how to use logic gates to construct a processor. We’re allowed to relegate certain things to niche expertise; I would never argue with this. In these respects, the concrete has cured. We can concern ourselves primarily with building atop it.But threads? UTF-8? Standard library code? These are not in that category.9Unrelatedly, nothing will give you the experience of failure like trying to popularize your homegrown JavaScript framework.10If you’re on a Mac and you don’t know what “homebrew” is, you’re screwed here.11Correct: my thread scheduler will crash if all threads are sleeping at once.A convenient trick that many OSes use to handle this is a dedicated “idle task”, which has the lowest priority and only runs if no other threads can run.I didn’t implement that.2Share this postPretty Good BlogWhat Threads Are, Part 2Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMore5SharePrevious",

    "content": "May 28, 2025What does \"Undecidable\" mean, anywayAn explainer for people who don't know computer science and are mildly curiousSystems DistributedI'll be speaking atSystems Distributednext month! The talk is brand new and will aim to showcase some of the formal methods mental models that would be useful in mainstream software development. It has added some extra stress on my schedule, though, so expect the next two monthly releases ofLogic for Programmersto be mostly minor changes.What does \"Undecidable\" mean, anywayLast week I readAgainst Curry-Howard Mysticism, which is a solid article I recommend reading. But this newsletter is actually aboutone comment:I like to see posts like this because I often feel like I can’t tell the difference between BS and a point I’m missing. Can we get one for questions like “Isn’t XYZ (Undecidable|NP-Complete|PSPACE-Complete)?”I've already written one of these forNP-complete, so let's do one for \"undecidable\". Step one is to pull a technical definition from the bookAutomata and Computability:A property P of strings is said to be decidable if ... there is a total Turing machine that accepts input strings that have property P and rejects those that do not. (pg 220)Step two is to translate the technical computer science definition into more conventional programmer terms. Warning, because this is a newsletter and not a blog post, I might be a little sloppy with terms.Machines and Decision ProblemsIn automata theory, all inputs to a \"program\" are strings of characters, and all outputs are \"true\" or \"false\". A program \"accepts\" a string if it outputs \"true\", and \"rejects\" if it outputs \"false\". You can think of this as automata studying all pure functions of typef :: string -> boolean. Problems solvable by finding such anfare called \"decision problems\".This covers more than you'd think, because we can bootstrap more powerful functions from these. First, as anyone who's programmed in bash knows, strings can represent any other data. Second, we can fake non-boolean outputs by instead checking if a certain computation gives a certain result. For example, I can reframe the functionadd(x, y) = x + yas a decision problem like this:IS_SUM(str) { x, y, z = split(str, \"#\") return x + y == z }Then becauseIS_SUM(\"2#3#5\")returns true, we know2 + 3 == 5, whileIS_SUM(\"2#3#6\")is false. Since we can bootstrap parameters out of strings, I'll just say it'sIS_SUM(x, y, z)going forward.A big part of automata theory is studying different models of computation with different strengths. One of the weakest is called\"DFA\". I won't go into any details about what DFA actually can do, but the important thing is that itcan'tsolveIS_SUM. That is, if you give me a DFA that takes inputs of formx#y#z, I can always find an input where the DFA returns true whenx + y != z,oran input which returns false whenx + y == z.It's really important to keep this model of \"solve\" in mind: a program solves a problem if it correctly returns true on all true inputs and correctly returns false on all false inputs.(total) Turing MachinesA Turing Machine (TM) is a particular type of computation model. It's important for two reasons:By theChurch-Turing thesis, a Turing Machine is the \"upper bound\" of how powerful (physically realizable) computational models can get. This means that if an actual real-world programming language can solve a particular decision problem, so can a TM. Conversely, if the TMcan'tsolve it, neither can the programming language.1It's possible to write a Turing machine that takesa textual representation of another Turing machineas input, and then simulates that Turing machine as part of its computations.Property (1) means that we can move between different computational models of equal strength, proving things about one to learn things about another. That's why I'm able to writeIS_SUMin a pseudocode instead of writing it in terms of the TM computational model (and why I was able to usesplitfor convenience).Property (2) does several interesting things. First of all, it makes it possible to compose Turing machines. Here's how I can roughly ask if a given number is the sum of two primes, with \"just\" addition and boolean functions:IS_SUM_TWO_PRIMES(z): x := 1 y := 1 loop { if x > z {return false} if IS_PRIME(x) { if IS_PRIME(y) { if IS_SUM(x, y, z) { return true; } } } y := y + 1 if y > x { x := x + 1 y := 0 } }Notice that without theif x > z {return false}, the program would loop forever onz=2. A TM that always halts for all inputs is calledtotal.Property (2) also makes \"Turing machines\" a possible input to functions, meaning that we can now make decision problems about the behavior of Turing machines. For example, \"does the TMMeither accept or rejectxwithin ten steps?\"2IS_DONE_IN_TEN_STEPS(M, x) { for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) { `simulate M(x) for one step` if(`M accepted or rejected`) { return true } } return false }Decidability and UndecidabilityNow we have all of the pieces to understand our original definition:A property P of strings is said to be decidable if ... there is a total Turing machine that accepts input strings that have property P and rejects those that do not. (220)LetIS_Pbe the decision problem \"Does the input satisfy P\"? ThenIS_Pis decidable if it can be solved by a Turing machine, ie, I can provide someIS_P(x)machine thatalwaysaccepts ifxhas property P, and always rejects ifxdoesn't have property P. If I can't do that, thenIS_Pis undecidable.IS_SUM(x, y, z)andIS_DONE_IN_TEN_STEPS(M, x)are decidable properties. IsIS_SUM_TWO_PRIMES(z)decidable? Some analysis shows that our corresponding program will either find a solution, or havex>zand return false. So yes, it is decidable.Notice there's an asymmetry here. To prove some property is decidable, I need just to need to findoneprogram that correctly solves it. To prove some property is undecidable, I need to show that any possible program, no matter what it is, doesn't solve it.So with that asymmetry in mind, do are thereanyundecidable problems? Yes, quite a lot. Recall that Turing machines can accept encodings of other TMs as input, meaning we can write a TM that checksproperties of Turing machines. And, byRice's Theorem, almost every nontrivial semantic3property of Turing machines is undecidable. The conventional way to prove this is to first find a single undecidable propertyH, and then use that to bootstrap undecidability of other properties.The canonical and most famous example of an undecidable problem is theHalting problem: \"does machine M halt on input i?\" It's pretty easy to prove undecidable, and easy to use it to bootstrap other undecidability properties. But again,anynontrivial property is undecidable. Checking a TM is total is undecidable. Checking a TM acceptsanyinputs is undecidable. Checking a TM solvesIS_SUMis undecidable. Etc etc etc.What this doesn't mean in practiceI often see the halting problem misconstrued as \"it's impossible to tell if a program will halt before running it.\"This is wrong. The halting problem says that we cannot create an algorithm that, when applied to an arbitrary program, tells us whether the program will halt or not. It is absolutely possible to tell if many programs will halt or not. It's possible to find entire subcategories of programs that are guaranteed to halt. It's possible to say \"a program constructed following constraints XYZ is guaranteed to halt.\"The actual consequence of undecidability is more subtle. If we want to know if a program has property P, undecidability tells usWe will have to spend time and mental effort to determine if it has PWe may not be successful.This is subtle because we're so used to living in a world where everything's undecidable that we don't really consider what the counterfactual would be like. In such a world there might be no need for Rust, because \"does this C program guarantee memory-safety\" is a decidable property. The entire field of formal verification could be unnecessary, as we could just check properties of arbitrary programs directly. We could automatically check if a change in a program preserves all existing behavior. Lots of famous math problems could be solved overnight.(This to me is a strong \"intuitive\" argument for why the halting problem is undecidable: a halt detector can be trivially repurposed as a program optimizer / theorem-prover / bcrypt cracker / chess engine. It'stoo powerful, so we should expect it to be impossible.)But because we don't live in that world, all of those things are hard problems that take effort and ingenuity to solve, and even then we often fail.Update for the InternetThis was sent as a weekly newsletter, which is usually on topics likesoftware history,formal methods,unusual technologies, and thetheory of software engineering.

I wanted to see if I could speed up inference by extracting the learned logic circuit from the NN. So, I wrote some code to extract and compile the extracted logic circuit to bit-parallel C (with some optimizations to remove gates that don’t contribute to the output). I benchmarked the original NN against the extracted 300-line single-threaded C program.; compiling the NN to C resulted in a 1,744× speedup! Crazy, right?Here’s the repo:~354 lines of Python/JAX,~331 lines of C, if you want toreproduce itand/or mess around.The longer storyWhile plumbing the intertubes (as one does), I came acrossthis fun publicationby theSelf Organising Systemsgroup at Google, aboutDifferentiable Logic Cellular Automata. This research caught my attention (I mean, who doesn’t love a pretty picture), and as I read it, I realized the whole idea wouldn’t betoohard to replicate. (Which is crazy, becausethisis crazy. I mean, the authors citecreatingcomputroniumas a source of inspiration. Awesome!)To break things down a little bit:Differentiable LogicCellular Automatais a quite a mouthful, I know, but the idea is the straightforward composition of two existing ideas:Cellular Automata (CA)are grids of cells, where each cell changes over time according to somelocalrule. The most famous cellular automata areConway’s Game of Lifeand perhapsRule 110. We call this local update rule akernel, a function that looks at the local neighborhood around a cell to calculate the cell’s next state. By applying the kernel to each cell in our grid, we step the cellular automata forward through time. Simple rules can give rise tostrikingly complex behaviour.Neural Cellular Automata (NCA)are a variant of CA that replace the kernel function with a neural network. NCA can be trained to learn known kernels (what I do), or more generally, to learn kernels that give rise to a specified target behavior.Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs)are like neural networks, with two key differences. First, theweights are fixed, and set to 0 or 1; each neuron has exactly two inputs (one left, one right) We call these weightswires. Since wires are fixed, welearn the activation function. In this case, our activation function is a weighted linear combination of a set of 16 logic gates, applied to the two inputs. Essentially, we learn which logic gate should be used for each node in a fixed circuit. (If you’re a little lost, don’t worry, later, I’ll go into more detail to describe what this looks like in practice.)After reading theoriginal publication, I wanted to play with a few different experiments. To start, I wanted to replicate the research without looking at it too closely, to give room for creative misinterpretation, to understand what decisions were important. I also wanted to mess around with whatever the result of that was, until somethinginterestingfell out. Consider this to be something of a pilot episode: there is a lot I still would like to experiment with. (Like fluid simulation! We could find a circuit for the kernel rule forReintegration Tracking. Wouldn’t that be neat?)I tried something new for the first time, which was to keep ajournalduring development. I have no idea why I’ve never done this before, because it made recording training runs, figuring out what to debug, tracking next steps, and scoping changessomuch easier. (Not to mention writing this write-up!) This project took three days (well,fourfive if you count this write-up), and it’s cool to see how much progress I made each day.Conway’s what? A quick recapConway’s Game of Lifeis a Cellular Automata that takes place on a 2D grid of square cells. Each cell has 8 neighbors. At each step, looking at this 3×3 neighborhood, we decide whether each cell is alive or dead, according to two rules:If the cell has exactly 3 live neighbors, it is alive.If the cell has exactly 2 live neighbors, and is alive, it remains alive.I guess there’s a harsh third rule which is, “otherwise, if the cell is dead, it stays dead”. You may already begin to see how this could be written as a logic circuit. Here’s one way: given an array,inputs, with 9 cells where0is dead,1is alive, we can write:n =sum(inputs) - alive# neighbors excluding centeralive_next = (n ==3) or ((n ==2) and alive)The hard part, you might glean, would be coming up with a compact circuit for countingn, the number of neighbors. That’s what we’re up against: given a 9-bit input, we’re going to try to learn a circuit of logic gates whose output matches the 1-bitalive_nextoutput, end-to-end.N.B.You should try coming up with a circuit yourself, by hand! I did, it’s not too crazy. Here’s a hint: A cell has 8 neighbors. You can count how many cells are alive for any pair of inputs:xorfor 1,andfor 2. Can you use two pairs to count 4? What about 8? Once you can determine whether the neighborhood count is 2 or 3, the rest is fairly straightforward. How many logic gates did you use? How deep is your circuit?In the beginning was JAXNow, I suppose I’ll show my age by saying that my knowledge of ML frameworks is stuck around 2017, witholdKeras (never change,Sequential) and TensorFlow (before2.0). I used to mess around with GANs (StyleGAN<3) and I even implementedRNDon top ofPPOat some point! So I have a good intuition of the basics. Much has been lost to the sands of time, aside from ahandful of random projectsshotgunned across GitHub. Sigh.Well, as Oogway would say, “Yesterday ishistory, tomorrow is amystery, but today… is a gift. That is why it is called thepresent.” There is no better day than today to get back on your A-game.JAXis amachine learning frameworkfor Python. I think of it as numpy on steroids. JAX has an API-compatible implementation of numpy living atjax.jnp: you can do all the fun matrix stuff (like multiplication!) and you get a couple things for free:gradwillcompute the gradientof any non-sadistic function. It does this using automaticreverse-mode differentiation, but you can get as fancy as you’d like.vmapwillautomatically parallelizeand vectorize computations that can be run in parallel. For example, I use vmap to batch training in my implementation.jitwilljust-in-time compileall of the above, and can produce code that runs on the GPU. Compiling Python at the library level using decorators is crazy!JAX has an ecosystem of libraries that mix and match these operations to build more powerful primitives.Optax, for example, implements commonoptimization strategies, likeadamw, on top ofjax.grad.Flax, is a NN library built on top of JAX. (Tbh, flax is a little confusing: there’snn(deprecated),linen,nnx. Everyone uses linen but the flax devs want people to use nnx it seems).N.B.One other thing I like about JAX is that randomness is reproducible. All functions that generate non-deterministic output take a RNGkey, and keys can be split into subkeys. The root key is generated when you set the seed; everything else derives from the root key. This means if you run a program twice, you’ll have the same initialization, same training samples, same convergence. It makes debugging a lot easier, because you can reproduce e.g. a blow-up during training with some patience.Continuous relaxationTo learn a circuit, we need some way to translate the hard, discrete language of logic into the smooth, continuous language ofgradients. (Gradients, now those are something an optimizer can get a handle on!)A logic gate, likeand(a, b), is a function of two inputs; we can arrange them into a table like so:01000101Here, inputs are defined to be exactly0or1. What if the inputsvarybetween0.0and1.0; is there a continuous function of two inputsf(a, b)that behaves likeand(a, b)at the boundary? Well, yes,f(a, b) = a * bfits the bill. We can say thata * bacontinuous relaxationofand(a, b). There are 16 fundamental logical functions of two inputs; here they all are, along with a continuous relaxation for each:gaterelaxationgaterelaxationfalse0.true1.anda*bnand1. - a*ba&~ba - a*bb/~a1. - a + a*baanot a1. - ab&~ab - a*ba/~b1. - b + a*bbbnot b1. - bxora+b - 2.*a*bxnor1. - (a+b - 2.*a*b)ora+b - a*bnor1. - (a+b - a*b)This is great! (It’s fun to try to derive continuous relaxations yourself.) With this groundwork in place, we could create a “learnable logic gate” of sorts by taking a weighted sum of each relaxation. In JAX, usingjnp:jnp.sum(gate_weight *gate_all(left, right))# axis=0Here,gate_allreturns a vector where each entry is the result of one of the functions above. If we want to make sure that the gate weights stay in a reasonable range, we can apply asoftmaxto the learned vectorw, which squashes each gate weight to be between0.0and1.0:gate_weight = jnp.exp(w) / jnp.sum(jnp.exp(w))# axis=0, keepdims=TrueWe can train a network to learn these gate weights. Once we have a trained network, can replace the softmax with anargmax(taking the gate with the highest weight). This gives us a circuit with a hard0or1as an output; a discrete logic gate is also much cheaper to compute. (It’s almost as if computers are full of them!)Hardness zeroWell, we have our continuous relaxations and we have a NN. Let’s just put them together, replacereluwithgate, and call it a day? Not so fast.Machine learning papers almost make research lookeffortless, as though NNs magically converge when enough data is forced through their weights. This could not be further from the truth: there are so many failure modes; so many experiments that have to be run to guess the right hyperparameters; training a NN requires a weird combination of patience (giving the model enough time to converge) and urgency (stopping runs early when something is wrong). It’s fun, but it can also be frustrating, yet somehow addicting.I could skip over the two days of elbow grease it took to get this working. However, differentiable logic gate networks train a little differently than your standard dense relu network, and there were a couple things, like how you initialize DLGNs, that surprised me.WiringAt the start of this project, I wanted to see if I could learn the wires in addition to the gates. I still think it’s possible, but it’s something I had to abandon to get the model to converge.I started this project by writing a simple dense NN with relu activation and standard SGD, just to see if things were working. They were, and my small model converged very quickly!In traditional NNs, it’s commonly-accepted wisdom that you should initialize the wire weight matrices according to a tight normal distribution centered around zero. This is what I did for the relu network above, and it worked like a charm!I switched fromrelutogateby adding two weight matrices per layer, one for the right gate input, the other for the left. After this switch, however, try as I might, the modelwould notconverge. I also started to worry about whether havingnegativewire weights would make it hard to extract the logical circuit after training. So, I thought some more, and decided to initialize wire weightsuniformlybetween 0 and 1. This performed even worse!Thinking some more, I had an epiphany: “well, since the goal is to learn a wiring, we should softmax the wires in the same way we softmax the gates!” In desperation, I implemented a row-wise softmax over wire weights initialized uniformly… this also went about as well as you would expect. (Poorly.)At this point I realized: maybe a fixed1or0wiring is not just a random choice, buthighlyessential! Wouldn’t a fixed wiring let the gradients propagate all the way to the gates at theinputend of the network, so the gates at theoutputend of the network could begin to converge? I began to look at how wiring was implemented in the paper; I decided to abandon my learned-wiring dreams for the time being.In hindsight, it’s obvious that how you wire a network determines how information flows through it, so it’s important that the wiring isgood, especially if the wiring is fixed. I don’t know why it took me so long to realize this.After I refactored everything to use fixed wiring, I first I tried completely random wiring. This did a lot better than any of the previous approaches, but was still nowherenearthe publication. After careful inspection, I realized that with this approach, you risk not wiring gates, or wiring two gates the same way, losing information as it flows through the network.My next thought was to wire the network like a tree. We had descending power-of-two layers: 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1; what if each layer was connected to the corresponding two cells in the layer before it? This way there is total information flow. Tree wiring worked like a charm, and it was at this point that I started to have hope.I read the publication more closely, and at this point I looked at thecolab notebook. The wiring technique used is interesting: it guarantees we get unique pairs, like tree wiring, but we also shuffle the branches between layers to allow for some cross-pollination. The algorithm looks something like this:defwire_rand_unique(key,m,n):key_rand, key_perm = random.split(key)evens = [(0,1), (2,3), ...]odds = [(1,2), (3,4), ...]padding =rand_pairs_pad(key_rand, m, n)pairs = jnp.array([*evens, *odds, *padding])perm = random.permutation(key_perm, pairs)returnwire_from_pairs(perm.T, m, n)(Note that as long as n ≤ m ≤ 2×n, there will be total network connection with no random padding.)With the wiring from the publication implemented, the model was within spitting distance of fully converging! That’s when one last revelationshook me to my bones.Initialize gates to pass throughThe biggest surprise was the way you’re supposed toinitializethe gate weights of a differentiable logic gate network; of course, it now makes100% sensein hindsight.Here’s the big idea: we want the gradients to reach the input of the network, but if we initialize gate weights uniformly, or even randomly, we’ll get a flat activation function. Flat activation functionskillall gradients, period. I realized this was happening when I wrote code to visualize each layer in the network, and watched it change over time:# [...]layer 3 (16, 8)▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▁ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▁ ▄ ▁ ▁ ▁▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▁ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▁ ▄ ▁ ▁ ▁▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ █▁ ▁ ▁ ▄ ▁ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▁ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▄ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁▄ ▄ ▄ ▁ ▄ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▄ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ █▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ █ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁layer 4 (16, 4)▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ █ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁▄ ▄ ▄ ▁ ▄ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▄ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ █ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▄▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ █ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁layer 5 (16, 2)▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▄ ▁ █ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▄ ▁ ▄ ▁▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ █ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁layer 6 (16, 1)▁ ▁ █ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▁F & .

A . & F~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~# gate order| FALSE | AND | A&!B | A || B&!A | B | XOR | OR || NOR | XNOR | NOT B | A/!B || NOT A | B/!A | NAND | TRUE |With dead gradients, I’d see the output gate converge, then the one before it, and so on until the gradients reached the input, at which point the later gates were so fixed in their ways that they were impossible to change, even as better earlier gate weights were discovered. Obviously, the performance of the network plateaus shortly thereafter.I didn’t see an obvious way around this problem, so I started to wonder if there was some weird trick to get around the problem… and there was. So I read the code.Of all the gates, these two stand out:gaterelaxationexplanationaaForward a, drop b.bbForward b, drop a.These pass-through gates do no mixing, and will propagate gradients straight along their wires, all the way to the input! This is critical! And in retrospect, I had missed a seemingly-innocuous line:To facilitate training stability, the initial distribution of gates is biased toward the pass-through gate.Of courseit is biased! There’s no way to train the network otherwise! So I made a simple one-line change, and, like that,test_loss_hard: 0.Perfect convergence:Epoch (3001/3001) in 0.0031 s/epoch[ 0.999 0.999 0.00173 0.000287 0.000537 ] [1. 1. 0. 0. 0.] [1. 1. 0. 0. 0.]train_loss: 0.000738; test_loss: 9.91e-05; test_loss_hard: 0At long last, it all fits together.HyperfrustrationWhat frustrates me is that, after correctly implementing the architecture from the publication, the main issues preventing convergence were seemingly arbitrary hyperparameter choices. In my journal I wrote:The model training code was good, as was the gate implementation. So whatwaswrong?The model was the wrong size (way too small).The model was initialized the wrong way (randomly, instead of with gate passthrough).The model did not have clipping in the optimizer, which seems like a rather arbitrary, hacky hyperparameter choice.Hyperparameters suck! I hate that I was pulling my hair out over why I wasn’t getting the same results when all that was different were the hyperparameters at play.I wonder how many research breakthroughs are possible but just sitting in hyperparameters beyond reach?Rather existential, I suppose. There are lots of other things I tried that didn’t work. Earlier, I tried to learn thewiringin addition to gates, but the network wouldn’t converge. I thought it was because the network was too complex, but now I’m convinced it’s because it was too small and initialized incorrectly. There is so much more I would like to try.N.B.All this wiring got me thinking about gaussian splatting of all things. You see, I was recently reading a paper aboutwhen to split gaussian splats; the rough idea is to split whenever the optimizer encounters a saddle with respect to any one splat. While watching underparameterized gate networks train, I would see them get stuck between a handful of gates on a given layer, and not converge further. I wonder if it would be possible to build a circuit network that grows over time, splitting gate saddles when loss stops going down? I suppose that’s what inspired the splat paper, so we’ve come full circle.Extracting the circuitAt this point we have learned aperfectbinary circuit that looks at a 3×3 cell neighborhood and computes the game of life kernel. Only one problem: This circuit is stuck as a pile of floating point numbers, tangled up in the vast sea of gate weights and wires. How will we ever get it out?By compiling it to C.This isn’t as hard as it sounds. All we have to do istraverse the network, layer by layer. We use our old friendargmaxto figure outwhich wires and gate to usefor each gate in the circuit.At this point, we have a massive network. However, only a tiny fraction of the gates are used! (Most gates are still pass-through.) So I implemented two optimizations to clean up the circuit:Dead code eliminationgets rid of all gates that do not contribute to the output. We’re not doing anything fancy here, like testing for truisms; just doing the simple thing and taking the transitive closure of all dependencies, starting from the root output, going backwards:defext_elim(instrs,root):out = []req =set([root])forinstrininstrs[::-1]:(o, idx, l, r) = instrifo in req:req =ext_add_deps(req, idx, l, r)out.append(instr)returnlist(out[::-1])Copy propagationlets us get rid of all those pesky useless pass-through gates by forwarding their output to all downstream gates. This time we go forward, and keep track of what to rename pass-through gates.defext_copy_prop(instrs,root):out = []rename =dict()forinstrininstrs:(o, idx, l, r) = instrifl in rename: l = rename[l]ifr in rename: r = rename[r]ifo == root: out.append((o, idx, l, r))elifidx ==3: rename[o] = lelifidx ==5: rename[o] = relse: out.append((o, idx, l, r))returnout(Index3and5are the indices of the pass-through gates.)After this, we do a simple rename for all gates (since we’ve decimated the number of gates in use), and emit C. This is just a big switch-case:defext_gate_name(idx,l,r):names = [lambdaa,b:\"0\",lambdaa,b:f\"{a}&{b}\",lambdaa,b:f\"{a}& ~{b}\",# ...lambdaa,b:f\"~({a}&{b})\",lambdaa,b:\"~0\",]returnnames[idx](l, r)After formatting, we get along list of instructionsthat looks like this:cellconway(cellin[9]) {// ... 157 lines hiddencell hh = hc ^ gs;cell hi = hb & ~gy;cell hj = hh & hi;cell hk = hg & cy;cell out = hj | hk;returnout;}And like that, all your floats are belong to us. Here’s the final tally for each basic logical operation used in the circuit. (Note that some gates, e.g. nand, are composed of multiple operations):GateCountand69or68xor17not16total170Nice. I don’t know why, but it’s satisfying to see a pretty even split betweenandandor, as withxorandnot. I wonder what the distribution looks like in real-world code. (I thought I never usedxor, but then I realized that!=is really justxorin disguise.)Bit-crunching CI pulled a sneaky little trick. I don’t know if you noticed. Here’s a hint:typedefuint64_tcell;That’s right: acellis not one grid cell, but 64! When we calculatecell conway(cell in[9]);, we are, throughbit-parallelism, computing the rule on 64 cells at once!We compile to C and produce a function containing the circuit,conway, but we need a runtime to saturate it. I took a compilers class this semester (6.1100), so I have been writing a lot ofUnnamed Subset of Cthis semester. With C on the mind, I wrote a little runtime. Here’s how it works.First, I define a board as a collection of cells:typedef struct{cell* cells;size_t cells_len;size_t width;size_t height;}board_t;Eachcellis just a horizontal slab, 64 bits wide. I’m lazy here, so I requirewidthbe a multiple of 64. We initialize this board with random state using anxorshiftprng I am currently lending from Wikipedia:// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift// constant is frac(golden_ratio) * 2**64// global state bad cry me a riveruint64_t rand_state =0x9e3779b97f4a7c55;uint64_trand_uint64_t() {uint64_t x = rand_state;x ^= x <<13;x ^= x >>7;x ^= x <<17;rand_state = x;returnx;}On to the meat and potatoes. The functionconwayrequires a list of9cells. The neighbors directly above and below are easy: we just index forward or back a row incells. The side-by-side neighbors are a bit harder. Luckily, we can just bitshift to the left and right to create two new boards. This works as long as we’re careful tocatch all bitsthat might fall into the bitbucket when we shift:voidboard_step_scratch_mut(board_t *board,board_t *scratch_left,board_t *scratch_right,// syntax highlighting breaks without a comma here, sigh) {// 5: dense loops and bitshifts,// 7: no beauty I can present.// 5: click the link above.}I guess a better illustration would be, to analogize:ceos hate these seats8-bit analogyscratch_left10011010 10011010 10011010 ...board01001101 01001101 01001101 ...scratch_right10100110 10100110 10100110 ...With all this machinery in place, we can step the board! I’m proud of this code:voidboard_step_mut(board_t *board,board_t *s_left,// scratchboard_t *s_right,board_t *s_out,// sigh) {board_step_scratch_mut(board, s_left, s_right);size_t step = board->width /64;size_t wrap = board->cells_len;for(size_t i =0; i < board->cells_len; i++) {cell in[9];size_t i_top = (i + wrap - step) % wrap;size_t i_bottom = (i + step) % wrap;// top rowin[0] = s_left->cells[i_top];in[1] = board->cells[i_top];in[2] = s_right->cells[i_top];// middle rowin[3] = s_left->cells[i];in[4] = board->cells[i];in[5] = s_right->cells[i];// bottom rowin[6] = s_left->cells[i_bottom];in[7] = board->cells[i_bottom];in[8] = s_right->cells[i_bottom];// update outputs_out->cells[i] =conway(in);}// double-bufferingcell* tmp_cells = board->cells;board->cells = s_out->cells;s_out->cells = tmp_cells;}*waves* welcome to the club. mention bananas in any comment about this project for immediate +10 respect.And there you have it. There’s some more code for printing that I haven’t included here. One call tomain, and you’re off to the races! If you’d like to absorb the monstrosity in full,here’s a link.(I mean, 331 lines of C, half generated. That can’t hurt anyone.)BenchmarksBenchmarking is always fraught with peril, especially for bold claims like\"GUYS! I found a 1,744× speedup!!\"so I'd like to qualify exactly what I'm measuring:I am comparing theinference speedof my Python JAX (with JIT) implementation against that of my bit-parallel C implementation.Disclaimer,because I’m certain someone won’t read the above. You can definitely simulateConway’s Game of Lifewith JAX a lot faster by not using a DLGN, if that’s your goal. (Indeed, I have a faster pure-JAX kernel to prepare the boards used for training!) Here, I want to compare floating-point GPU inference to bit-parallel CPU inference. And for fun, if you just want to simulate Conway’s Game of Life, you can totally shred with a faster algorithm likeHashlife, which I’vehalf-implemented before. These benchmarks, while semi-rigorous, are just for fun!If you want the exact setup, there arereproduction stepsin the repository, with more details in thejournal. Here’s my approach:I use a board of size 512×512 cells. I find the average time perstepin the C implementation, by runningstepon the board 100k times. I find the average time per pass in the Python JAX+JIT implementation, by predicting 512 batches of 512. Here are the results:methodμs/pass (512×512)μs/step (512×512)fpsspeedupPython71200—141×C—40.924,4001,744×And there it is:1,744×.N.B.Computing 512 batches of 512 was faster than a single batch of size 512×512 = 262,144, which would have been a more direct comparison. Take 1,744× with a grain of salt, if anything.I did some back-of-the-napkin math, and this seems to check out. On the JAX side, the network I’m evaluating is of size [9, 128×17, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]. Each 128 matrix-vector product requires ~16k floating-point multiplications. We have 17 of them, so we’re looking at at least ~270k flop for a single cell; we have 512×512 cells to evaluate, so lower bound is 70.7 gflop. All things considered, JAX is doing averygood job optimizing the workload. My machine can apparently do about 4.97 tflop/s: dividing that by the estimated 70.7 gflop workload, I get 70.3 fps, and as a lower bound, is ~within an order of magnitude of the 14 fps from the benchmark.The bit-parallel C implementation, on the other hand, is about~349 instructions long(Godbolt). Each instruction processes 64 bits in parallel, which works out to about 5.45 instructions per bit. There’s quite a bit of register spilling going on, and it takes time to write to memory. Given we have 512×512 cells, it should take around 1.43 million instrs per step. A core on my machine runs at about 3.70 gcycles/s. If we assume instruction latency is 1 cycle, we should expect 2,590 fps. But we measure a number nearly 10× higher! What gives? I expect something along the lines of “insane instruction-level parallelism”, but this is something I’ll have to come back to. Regardless, this is also within an order of magnitude of the measured figure. (Now I’m really curious! I’ll have to dig into it…)Well, there you have it:doing less work is indeed faster!News at 11.Next stepsI have lots of ideas about what to do next. Some ideas:Try learning a bigger circuit, like one for fluid simulation, usingreintegration tracking.Try optimizing further, by vectorizing with SIMD, or outputting a bit-parallel compute shader that runs on the GPU.Try lettingyoumess around with the project in-browser, by exporting various circuits at different points in training, so you can get a feel for how the network learns.Well, if you made it this far, you’re one of the real ones. I hope you enjoyed the read and learned something new. I certainly did in writing this! This post isn’t finished; I’d like to add a little in-browser demo, or visualization. Perfect is the enemy of the good. I’m saying adios to this project for now as I have a week off between finishing my first year at MIT and starting an internship writing Rust in SF this summer. I’m sure there will be plenty of time to stress the heck out about optimizing things later in life! Peace out homie.(Please don’t kill me for writing thousands of words about Conway’s Game of Life without asinglepicture or animation; I know, I’m working on it. Update: added a 600kb picture LOL. Animation coming soon.)Also,discussion on HN.Thank you to Shaw, Anthony, Mike, Clara and friends for taking a look, fixing typos, and providing feedback/moral support while I worked ondifflogic.Padded so you can keep scrolling.

    "link": "https://desktopdocs.com/?v=2025",
    "summary": "<p>A year ago, my co-founder launched Desktop Docs here on HN. It's a Mac app we built with Electron that uses CLIP embeddings to search photos and videos locally with natural language. We got positive feedback from HN and our first paying customers, but the app was almost 1GB and clunky to use.<p>TLDR; rebuilding in Rust was the right move.<p>So we rewrote the app with Rust and Tauri and here are the results:<p>- App size is 83% smaller: 1GB → 172MB\n- DMG Installer is 70% smaller: 232MB → 69.5MB\n- Indexing files is faster: A 38-minute video now indexes in ~3 minutes instead of 10-14 minutes\n- Overall more stability (old app used to randomly crash)<p>The original version worked, but it didn't perform well when you tried indexing thousands of images or large videos. We lost a lot of time struggling to optimize Electron’s main-renderer process communication and ended up with a complex worker system to process large batches of media files.<p>For months we wrestled with indecision about continuing to optimize the Electron app vs. starting a full rebuild in Swift or Rust. The main thing holding us back was that we hadn’t coded in Swift in almost 10 years and we didn’t know Rust very well.<p>What finally broke us was when users complained the app crashed their video calls just running in background. I guess that’s what happens when you ship an app with Chromium that takes up 200mb before any application code.<p>Today the app still uses CLIP for embeddings and Redis for vector storage and search, except Rust now handles the image and video processing pipeline and all the file I/O to let users browse their entire machine, not just indexed files.<p>For the UI, we decided to rebuild it from scratch instead of porting over the old UI. This turned out well because it resulted in a cleaner, simpler UI after living with the complexity of the old version.<p>The trickiest part of the migration was learning Rust. LLMs definitely help, but the Rust/Tauri community just isn’t as mature compared to Electron. Bundling Redis into the app was a permissioning nightmare, but I think our solution with Rust handles this better than what we had with Electron.<p>All in, the rebuild took about two months and still needs some more work to be at total parity with its Electron version, but the core functionality of indexing and searching files is way more performant than before and that made it worth the time. Sometimes you gotta throw away working code to build the right thing.<p>AMA about Rust/Tauri migration, Redis bundling nightmares, how CLIP embeddings work for local semantic search, or why Electron isn't always the answer.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44118023\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44118023</a></p>\n<p>Points: 518</p>\n<p># Comments: 368</p>",

    "content": "The history is this: back in the old days (2012), we used to store the entireCompiler Explorerstate in the URL. That got unwieldy (who would have thought encoding an entire compiler state in a URL might get a bit long?), so we added support for Google’s link shortenergoo.glin March 2014. That meant short links were of the formgoo.gl/abc123. Clicking a goo.gl link would eventually redirect you to the full URL link on our site, and we’d decode the state from the URL. In 2016,Stack Overflowbanned link shorteners because of how they cloak the actual destination of links. Abusers could post innocent goo.gl links that directed folks unwittingly to bad content. However, that meant our Compiler Explorer links were also affected. At the time, we had no intention of storing any user data, so we came up with a hack: we still used goo.gl, but we then rewrote the link we handed out to begodbolt.org/g/abc123(where the abc123 is the goo.gl unique ID). We then redirected any hits to/g/abc123togoo.gl/abc123, which then (finally) redirected back to godbolt.org with the appropriate state in the URL. If you’re keeping track, that’s three redirects to show you some assembly code. We were really committed to making things complicated. Later, we used Google’s API to avoid the redirection dance. By 2018, the limitations of storing state in the URL started to bite. There’s a limit to how long a URL can be (and we’d already started compressing the data in the URL), so we needed a better solution. We finally implemented our own storage solution: we hash the input, save the state as a JSON document onS3under the hash, and then give out a shortened form of the hash as agodbolt.org/z/hashbitURL. We useDynamoDBto store the mapping of shortened hashes to the full paths (accounting for partial collisions, etc.). And, amusingly, we check the short link’s hash for rude words and add deliberate extra information into the document until we no longer get a rude word. Yes, we literally check if your shortened URL contains profanity. Because apparently even random hashes can’t be trusted to keep it clean. This led tobug #1297, which remains one of my favourite issues we’ve ever had to fix. We still support thegodbolt.org/g/abc123links, but… despite Googlesolemnly promisingthat “all existing links will continue to redirect to the intended destination,” it went read-only a few years back, and now they’refinally sunsetting itin August 2025. Here I was in 2014, thinking I was so clever using Google’s shortener. “It’ll be around forever!” I said. “Google never discontinues products!” I said. Er… That means we’ll no longer be able to resolve goo.gl-based links! Which is, to use technical terminology, a bit pants. One of my founding principles is that Compiler Explorer links should last forever. I can’t do anything about thereallylegacy actualgoo.gllinks, but I can do something about thegodbolt.org/g/abc123links! Over the last few days, I’ve been scraping everywhere I can think of, collating the links I can find out in the wild, and compiling my own database of links1– and importantly, the URLs they redirect to. So far, I’ve found 12,000 links from scraping: 12,298 rescued links and counting - not bad for a few days of digital archaeology We’re nowusing the database in preferencetogoo.glinternally, so I’m also keeping an eye on new “g” links that we don’t yet have. Thanks toPeter Cordesfor reminding us about this issue andbringing it to our attention2. If you have a secret cache of godbolt.org/g/abc123 links you have lying around, now’s the time to visit each of them! That will ensure they’re in my web logs and I’ll add them to the database. Otherwise, sadly, in August 2025 those links will stop working, joining the great digital graveyard alongside Flash games and GeoCities pages. This whole saga reinforces why I’m skeptical of relying on third-party services for critical infrastructure. Google’s URL shortener was supposed to be permanent. The redirect chains we built were clever workarounds that bought us time, but ultimately, the only way to truly keep a promise of “URLs that last forever” is to own the entire stack. It’s been a fascinating archaeological dig through the internet, hunting down these legacy links like some sort of digital Indiana Jones, except instead of ancient artifacts I’m rescuing compiler flags and optimization examples. Each one represents someone’s attempt to share knowledge, ask a question, or demonstrate a concept. Preserving them feels like preserving a small piece of programming history. So if you’ve got old Compiler Explorer links bookmarked somewhere, dust them off and give them a click. You’ll be helping preserve a little corner of the internet’s shared knowledge – and keeping a promise I made back in 2012. And hey, at least this time I’m in control of the infrastructure. What could possibly go wrong? This article was written by a human, but links were suggested by and grammar checked by an LLM. I have a local sqlite database but the production side uses Dynamo.↩ Peter is one of the most prolific Stack Overflow users on the subject of low level programming.

Dense nodes, packed with galaxies and gas, are connected by long, thin,filamentsof galaxies and gas, all surrounded by largely emptyvoids. This structure resembles the neural network in a brain, and is known as theCosmic Web. Its extraordinary scale and complexity was not predicted in advance of observation, and came as a huge surprise. So, how did all this unexpected structure form?This is – and I cannot emphasise this enough – not a photo of the Cosmic Web. We don’t have fabulously detailed photos like this, for all sorts of reasons. This is a computer-generated image of what we think the Cosmic Web looks like, taken from the Millennium Simulation (which we will talk about later). But yeah, it probably looks a bit like this. The bright yellow blobs are clusters and superclusters of galaxies. The pink and purple threads joining them are filaments, also containing gas and galaxies (yellow dots). The dark spaces are voids.

Licensed under theCreative CommonsAttribution-Share Alike 4.0 Internationallicense.THE CURRENT, PASSIVE, ANSWERThe current mainstream answer to that question is calledLambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM ), and it is entirely passive. Based on gravity gradually pulling everything into shape, it requires huge quantities of (unfortunately, to date, entirely theoretical) “dark matter” to work. (Plus a lot of “dark energy” – that’s the lambda bit.) Despite decades of refinement, Lambda Cold Dark Matter still can’t coherently explain all the relevant observed phenomena without making some alarmingly ad hoc, post-observation adjustments. (See theCusp/Core problem; See theMissing Satellites problem; etc.)Crucially, it also predictsbottom-up structure formation, with mature galaxies assumed to form gradually, and hierarchically – that is, through a long, slow, random process of repeated gravitational mergers between much smaller, messier, and unstructured clumps of stars. This means it utterly failed to predict the rapid, early, efficient formation of huge numbers of large, bright, massive, startlingly mature galaxies revealed by NASA’s newJames Webb Space Telescopeover the last two and a half years. Whether dark matter actually exists or not, it clearly isn't sufficient by itself to explain what we observe.A new theory of structure formation is therefore required.AN ALTERNATIVE, ACTIVE, ANSWERIn this post, I will lay out, for the first time in one place, a new, active, alternative model: the Blowtorch Theory of structure formation. It argues that large numbers of extremely early, sustained, supermassive black hole jets actively shaped the universe's structure in its first few hundred million years, largely through electromagnetic processes. These jets form vast, low-pressure cavities in the dense gas of the compact early universe, and lay down magnetic field lines, that—expanded by the universe’s growth, and shaped by later gravitational and kinetic events—go on to form the voids and filaments of the Cosmic Web we see today.A MORE FRUGAL ANSWERImportantly, this entire process of active structure formation by jets (assisted by gravity from ordinary matter) can be fully described without any need for dark matter. No new particles, and no new physics, are required.SUPPORTIVE EVIDENCERecent evidence of unexpectedly large and early supermassive black holes (such as UHZ1 –which is as massive as all the stars in its galaxy put together), unexpectedly large and early jets (such asPorphyrion– which is a couple of hundred times longer than our Milky Way galaxy is wide,and indeed 40% longer than theory said was possible) – and, above all,large-scale extremely early rapid galaxy formation around active supermassive black holes, gives a great deal of support to this new theory.(And even as this Blowtorch Theory post was being researched and written, a paper was published detailing an extraordinaryblazar– a jet, a blowtorch, pointed straight at the earth from over 13 billion years ago, just 750 million years after the Big Bang – far earlier than Lambda Cold Dark Matter predicted, but slap-bang where the theory outlined here said we would find them. See:A blazar in the epoch of reionization, byEduardo Bañadoset al, Nature, December 17, 2024.)The second half of this post will outline the parent theory – three stage cosmological natural selection – which successfully predicted these extremely early supermassive black holes, and their jets, plus the associated rapid early galaxy formation, in advance of the first James Webb Space Telescope data.Blowtorch theory works, and can be explored, independently of its parent theory: however, three-stage cosmological natural selection gives an important and useful framework for more deeply understanding blowtorch theory and its implications.But let’s start by laying out in more detail the problem our new theory solves.INTO THE VOID“And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.”–Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil (1886)THE PROBLEM, IN MORE DETAILCosmic voids are vast regions in our universe containing almost no stars, galaxies, or gas.They’re not vague, blurry, density fluctuations, either. These voids are sharply bounded, with densities about an order of magnitude lower than their surroundings. In the main body, density is less than 10% of the universe’s average (often much less); near the edge, it rises to 20%, and then sharply to 100% at the walls.We didn’t predict their existence.We only discovered them in 1978. (Hats off toGregoryandThompson, and, independently,Jõeveer, Einasto and Tago.)And we were startled to discover they take up more than 80% of the universe’s volume, while containing only a tiny fraction of its matter.3D MAPSIn the late 1970s, large-scale redshift measurements of galaxies – tracking how far their visible light shifted into the red as they moved away from us – allowed us to map the universe with depth for the first time. Before this, our maps were essentially 2D, like a sheet of paper, with near and far objects overlapping; we had no way of knowing if a vast empty space separated them.But with these new 3D maps, we discovered that over 90% of all stars, galaxies, and gas are crammed into just 20% of the universe. In fact, themajorityof stars and galaxies by mass are packed into the dense regions we call clusters and superclusters, which occupy less than 1% of the universe’s volume. These clusters form dense nodes, connected by filaments along which gas appears to travel in massive flows.The result is a dynamic network that resembles a brain’s neurons, or a city’s transport network, far more than it does random clouds of gas.If you have trouble with cosmological visualisation (some don’t, some do), just imagine the universe as a country, and galaxies as buildings, ranging in size from huts to gigafactories: nearly all the buildings, especially the largest, are packed tightly together in isolated villages and towns (dense nodes containing clusters and superclusters), taking up only 1-2% of the land. An extensive network of roads, motorways, and canals (the filaments) connects these hubs, spreading over ten to twenty times as much land, mostly to transport gas for the star-making factories in the towns. The remaining 80% of land is almost empty. (Voids.)The top half of this image shows neurons and glial cells. The bottom half is that Millennium Simulation image again, of filaments and voids. So, yes, the Cosmic Web looks remarkably like a brain, or a 3-D map of a modern industrial country at night. Both of which are complex, orderly, dynamic structures resulting from highly directional evolutionary processes.

The Quantitative Comparison Between the Neuronal Network and the Cosmic Web.Front. Phys, published online November 16, 2020.These complex, network-like structures came as a huge shock to astronomers. 1981 was the year it became a crisis, whenRobert Kirshner,Stephen Gregory, andPaul Schechterdiscovered theBoötes Void. It was 250,000,000 light years in diameter – so you could line up 2,500 copies of our own Milky Way galaxy, side by side, inside it. Such a vast space should contain thousands of galaxies – but the Boötes Void (now often known fondly as the Great Nothing) only contained roughly sixty…This wasn’t just a failure of prediction; it was a revealing failure of observation. We had been looking at the entire universe—through a huge range of telescopes, across all frequencies, from radio to x-rays—for decades. Yet we had completely failed to see the actual structure of what we were observing.This failure wasn’t entirely the fault of the astronomers; voids, after all, are empty, making them easy to overlook. But discovering the scale and sharpness of these voids threw into high relief a deeply revealing incorrect assumption that underlay all cosmology.Astronomers had assumed, right up until this point, that our universe, on the larger scales, could be treated like a simple gas in equilibrium, with galaxies behaving like gas molecules, all spread out randomly. Sure, theorists like the great Belarusian physicistYakov Zeldovich(father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb) had done some interesting work, in the early 1970s, on how matter might collapse asymmetrically under gravity – but prior to the redshift surveys of the late 1970s and early 80s, any astronomer or cosmologist would have told you that our universe couldn’t contain anything likethe Böotes Void– let alone something like theSloan Great Wall(discovered in 2003), a filament stuffed with galaxies and gas that’s 1.4billionlight-years long. From a distance, statistically, the universe was assumed to be entirely smooth, with no structure. Simple matter, obeying simple gas laws.The great Stephen Hawking, presenting at a conference in Seattle in 2012. Have a look at the left-hand side of the image behind him. That’s what mainstream cosmology, based on Lambda Cold Dark Matter, thought they would see in the early universe, when we finally got data: a random, bottom-up mess, with no structure, and definitely no galaxies, for the first billion years. They were completely wrong. CREDIT: AP Photo / Ted S. WarrenThis incorrect assumption emerged from an even more fundamental unexamined assumption: that our universe was a one-off, with no history, in which randomly distributed matter with arbitrary characteristics blindly obeyed arbitrary laws, with random consequences.That the first basic assumption had turned out to be utterly, eye-wateringly wrong should have led to some introspection in cosmology, astronomy, and astrophysics about the validity of the second, and even more fundamental, unexamined assumption. But it didn’t.THE MAINSTREAM SOLUTION – LAMBDA COLD DARK MATTER – AND ITS FAILUREInstead, they back-engineered a new theory from scratch, to fit the startling new data. Fair enough—when you’ve got something completely wrong, you need a new theory. But this “new” theory tried to fix the problem as simply as possible (since the deeper unexamined assumption was still that the development of our universe was just the simple addition of random processes), and thus relied on gravity alone. That might seem odd to you (and it should certainly seem odd to you after reading this post), given thatelectromagnetism is an astonishing 36 orders of magnitude stronger than gravity. That means the electromagnetic force exerted by a single electron is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger than the gravitational force it exerts. (Thus a modest fridge magnet, or some static from your hair, can cause an object to defy the gravitational pull of the entire Earth.) How can you leave electromagnetism out of the picture? But, in fact, this decision made total sense (given their unexamined foundational assumptions), and was entirely uncontroversial at the time.That's because gravity is simple, and additive. Gravity can’t be blocked, reversed, or cancelled. Add more matter; it bends spacetime further; you get more gravity. That’s it, done. A large mass of matter will therefore always attract more matter gravitationally, and get bigger over time. But any large positive electromagnetic charge will attract nearbynegativecharges, which will immediately neutralise it. And so, in a random, chaotic, structureless environment, gravity is self-reinforcing: but electromagnetism is self-cancelling.And so they understandably (but as we shall show, wrongly) assumed that electromagnetism couldn't have any effect at cosmic scales.Zeldovich got back to work and, in papers likeGiant Voids in the Universe(written withEinastoandShandarin, 1982), andThe Large Scale Structure of the Universe 1. General Properties. One- and Two- Dimensional Models(withArnoldandShandarin, also 1982) found a way that gravitational collapse could give you something that approximated, roughly, to filaments and voids. Sure, the voids he got in these papers were too small, and too round (compared to what we were seeing), and there were a lot of other problems (it couldn’t really explain why galaxies were stable, and why everything didn’t just continue collapsing). But it was a promising approach, and we didn’t have any other theories. So, other cosmological theorists adopted it (Zeldovich himself died in 1987), and got to work developing it, adding an “adhesion model”, and a few other tweaks, to the original Zeldovich approximation, to try and make it work (i.e, get matter to stick together and actually produce galaxies).There was one problem, however. When they added it all up, the matter they could see – the stars, galaxies and gas made from all the standard particles we know about, called for short “baryonic matter” – didn't have enough mass to pull everything into these extreme shapes by their gravity alone. But gravity was believed to be the only force capable of shaping anything at cosmic scales! This forced the theorists to introduce massive quantities of dark matter—imaginary particles that don’t exist in the standard model of particle physics, invented purely to patch up issues like this one (and so alsothe galactic rotation problem, certaingravitational lensing anomalies, someodd features of the Cosmic Microwave Background, etc.)Since no one’s ever seen any dark matter, it can be given any properties you want. And that, regrettably but understandably, makes it extremely seductive.Sprinkle enough of this marvellous stuff you’ve just invented precisely where you’d like it, give it the properties you most desire, and—what a wonderful surprise!—you can coax everything into the shapes we observe, using gravity alone. Kind of. If you squint. And if that doesn’t quite work, just add inDark Energy(first proposed in 1998 - yeah, that’s the Lambda again). Or maybeDark Flow(first proposed in 2008). OrDark Radiation(first proposed in 2009). Or my personal favorite,Dark Fluid!(First proposed back in 2005). It has “negative mass”—yes, just likephlogiston(another imaginary substance that mainstream science once firmly believed in, for reasons which made a lot of sense at the time, but which turned out to be wrong). WholeDark Sectorsnow exist: rich landscapes of imaginary quantum fields, across which wander escaped zoos of hypothetical particles,none of which have ever been observed.Dark photons!Sterile neutrinos!Axions! A new “dark” gauge group, why not, that is completely unconnected to the actual Standard Model gauge group! True, many of these later suggestions are fringe theories, with little support. But such new theories keep being proposed, because Lambda Cold Dark Matter, for all its undoubted successes (and you don’t get to be the leading mainstream theory without some big successes), keeps running into new problems, and therefore needs all the help it can get.As you can see, with dark matter, likeblack tar heroin, once you’ve started, it’s hard to stop. And as time passes, you need more and more to get the same hit. After fifty years of tirelessly tweaking this wonderful, seductive, never-quite-there theory, how are we doing? Well, to drag everything into shape using only gravity now requires five times more dark matter than all the actual, observable, baryonic matter in our universe put together.That’sthe current mainstream explanation for filaments and voids. Five invisible universes worth of dark matter, with ever-changing properties that we never seem to be able to quite nail down, piled up on top of the one we can see. That – bizarrely – is considered the respectable, conservative theory.Great. There's only one real problem: this respectable new theory is based on the same set of deep, foundational, flawed assumptions which led to the original embarrassing failure of prediction. The theory is, therefore, unfortunately, wrong.PROBLEMS WITH ΛCDMDoes it approximate to the data? Sure, but so did Ptolemy’s earth-centred model of the universe (once you’d added enough epicycles). But there are, unfortunately, ongoing problems.The Bullet Clusterwas held up as evidence that dark matter is cold and collisionless. But theTrainwreck Clusterwas held up, for a while, as evidence that dark matter is not cold, and not collisionless – that it’s warm, and self-interacting. (Warm dark matter has also been used to explain the cusp/core problem, etc.) If you keep changing the very fundamentals of what dark matter is, to suit each new, ambiguous, observation – if there is simply nothing solid there to hang onto – then you don’t have a theory.Dark matter is basically a tiny, beautifully embroidered scientific duvet you can pull into position to cover any exposed area – but only at the price of exposing a different area.For example, if you tweak your dark matter to suit big galaxies, it stops working for small galaxies. (Thevexéd cusp/core problem.)Meanwhile, adjust it to perfectly explain the numbers and sizes of the galaxies we see all around us today, and it massively overpredicts the number of extremely small dwarf galaxies in the early universe.And the theorydidn’tpredict, and can’t explain, the recently discoveredUltra Diffuse Galaxies,DF2 and DF4– which behave as if they contain no dark matter at all.And now the new James Webb Space Telescope has finally shown us what's happening in the first billion years after the Big Bang… and Lambda Cold Dark Matter predictednoneof it.STRUCTURE, STRUCTURE, EVERYWHERE…The early universe turns out to be rich in structure – including huge numbers of mature galaxies when the universe was just 4 or 5% of its current age, some containing supermassive black holes as massive as all the stars in their galaxy put together. (So, not the small, messy, random clusters of stars, and slow, bottom-up galaxy formation, that ΛCDM predicted.) But don’t worry, theorists are now busy “explaining” these, after the fact, by fiddling with their numerous free parameters (some models have up to ten) – essentially adding epicycles.This doesn’t mean dark matter doesn’t exist (though I personally believe it does not, or certainly not in the form, and quantity, ΛCDM suggests) – but that, even if it does, it’s clearly grossly inadequate, on its own, to explain structure formation in our universe. With or without dark matter, there’s something else going on.Back here on Earth, fifty years of increasingly expensive attempts to directly detect it have turned up nothing at all. (Except, of course, more funding for bigger versions of the same failed experiments.)If the theory keeps failing at this scale, it might not be the universe that’s wrong, it might be the theory. Perhaps we've reached a point where we should stop trying to modify the universe with more and more imaginary matter, and start looking for a new theory.The trouble is… It’s too late. For the past twenty years, the largest and most costly computer simulations of structure formation in our universe – running from the originalMillennium, Millennium II, and Millennium XXL models, right up to the more recentUchuuandAbacusSummitsimulations – only include dark matter. Yeah, actual baryonic matter – the entire visible universe – is treated as a rounding error, and left out.Thousands of published papersare based on these simulations.Are there some simulations that include baryonic matter as well? Recently, yes, sure –EAGLE,SIMBA,IllustrisTNG,Magneticum,Horizon-AGN,FLAMINGO– but they typically cover much smaller areas, with some just modelling the formation of a single galaxy. (FLAMINGO is the exception here, in trying to model large-scale stuff too.) This is in many ways understandable: the behaviour of baryonic matter (i.e. the real world) is absurdly complex compared to that of dark matter (which is a mathematician’s dream of simplicity – hi again, Zeldovich!). It’s therefore much harder to model, and far more costly to compute, which is another reason everybody left it out until computers got fast enough to handle it.That’s not the real problem, though. The real problem is thatnoneof these new simulations that incorporate baryonic matter simulate it from first principles: they simply adjust a whole bunch of feedback parameters that, in the real world,we do not know(black hole feedback, star formation rates, gas dynamics), until they get a result that resembles observations. Hey, if I tune all these dials enough, the result looks like a galaxy! Cool! Are the feedback parameters chosen accurate to reality? Er, nobody knows! They are just another bunch of tuneable parameters, piled on top of the six tuneable parameters for dark matter. This is extremely expensive CGI, not science. It makes ΛCDM completely unfalsifiable.Or, as the greatVon Neumannput it,\"With four parametersI can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.\"–John von NeumannAlways reactive, never predictive: the dog of theory is simply chasing the car of observational data. The car turns left, the dog follows. Car turns right, dog follows. It’s a worrying sign, that the dog never knows where the car will go next.TWO CHEERS FOR COLD DARK MATTERHowever, I don’t want to be too dismissive of Lambda Cold Dark Matter as a theory. No theory gets to dominate its field without some juicy, solid wins. Back in the early 2000s, Lambda Cold Dark Matter accurately predictedthe Cosmic Microwave Background power spectrum– that is, it predicted the height of the soundwaves sloshing about in the tiny, ultra-hot, ultra-dense, fluid, early universe – in the brief era before light and matter uncoupled and released seventy percent ofall the photons in the universe todayin a single, universe-wide flash. (That flash, redshifted by the expansion of the universe, now forms the Cosmic Microwave Background.) NASA’sWMAP (the Wilson Microwave Anisotropy Probe), and the European Space Agency’sPlanck space observatory, both confirmed waves of the specific heights predicted by ΛCDM – heights that didn’t make sense with just baryonic matter, but did with a lot of dark matter (and even more dark energy). That was a BIG win; after that, Cold Dark Matter became the “standard model” of cosmology.MORE MATTER, OR LESS GRAVITY? (COKE, OR PEPSI?)But if I’m going to mention that success, then I should also mention the successes of the main rival theory to ΛCDM,Modified Newtonian Gravity, or MOND. If ΛCDM tries to fix all the problems in the universe with more matter, then MOND tries to fix all the problems in the universe with less gravity. MOND’s also been around since the early 1980s, but, in 2021, it finally developed a model – theAether-Scalar-Tensor framework, or AeST – which ALSO maps perfectly onto the acoustic peaks revealed by WMAP and Planck. (It does it by proposing a new vector field and scalar field that duplicate the effects of Cold Dark Matter in the early universe – see“Aether scalar tensor theory: Linear stability on Minkowski space”, byConstantinos SkordisandTom Złośnik, and the more recent“Aether scalar tensor theory: Hamiltonian Formalism,”byMarianthi Bataki, Constantinos Skordis, and Tom Złośnik.)So you can get a fit to the data with an imaginary, invisible new particle; but you can also get a fit to the data with an imaginary, invisible new field. I worry that the real truth we are uncovering here is that imaginary, invisible new things, with a bunch of free parameters, can always be made to fit the data.ΛCDM and MOND are in fact now beautifully balanced in terms of success: ΛCDM is the most empirically successful for big-picture cosmology (except recently, as we have seen, in the early universe),while MOND is the most empirically successful on small, single-galaxy scales. And both are pretty bad at what the other is good at.But MOND arrived at a full cosmological theory second, and so – despite being just as successful (and just as unsuccessful) as ΛCDM – must play Pepsi to ΛCDM’s Coke.And Coke, as we have seen above, now dominates the world.The fact that we have two theories with almost identical success and failure rates – yet one is built into every model, and the other completely marginalised – is a sign that what is going on here is sociology, rather than science.But anyway, as a result of all this, dark matter is now baked into every mainstream model, as the single explanation for everything problematic, making it impossible to fix the actual underlying problems. They can’t even see what they’re looking at.And so a lot of brilliant people remain trapped inside a faulty paradigm.By contrast, the model I’m exploring actuallypredicts shit in advance.Feel free to check:Predictions here.Confirmation here……And in more technical form here……And more confirmation in accessible form here……And in more technical form here……And even more confirmation in accessible form here……And in more technical form here…This is an artist’s impression of the relativistic jets shooting out from both magnetic poles of a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy, LIKE GODDAMN BLOWTORCHES, creating huge cavities in the surrounding gas.

Calçada (ESO)So, is there a theory that can explain voids, filaments, and their magnetic fields, using only the matter we can observe—the particles in the Standard Model of particle physics—and the established laws of nature?Yes.It’s called Blowtorch Theory. No, you haven’t heard of it, because this is the first time it's been laid out in full in public like this. (Yes, as some of you know, I’ve been working on it, behind the scenes – talking to scientists, researching, getting feedback – for months; building on ten years of earlier research for a book on cosmological natural selection. The specific, original inspiration for this post/paper, however, was this terrific paper in Nature, back in September 2024, byMartijn S. S. L. Oei,Martin J. Hardcastle,Roland Timmerman,et al,on extremely large, sustained jets:Black hole jets on the scale of the cosmic web.) But first, an uncharacteristically modest note, giving praise where it’s due…WOBBLING HEROICALLY ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTSBlowtorch theory ultimately emerges from cosmological natural selection (as I’ll explain later), and therefore grows from the American theoretical physicistLee Smolin’s seminal ideas (which were in turn influenced by innovative work on evolutionary biology by the greatLynn MargulisandStephen Jay Gould), as well as excellent later work byClemént Vidal,John Smart,Louis Crane,Michael E. Priceand others. Of course their work, like mine, owes a profound debt to earlier work on black holes by those titans of cosmology,John Wheeler,Kip Thorne,Roger PenroseandStephen Hawking, and to breakthroughs in magnetohydrodynamics bySteven BalbusandJohn Hawley(plus many others). I’m also borrowing fromPriya Natarajan,Volker Bromm,Avi Loeb, andMarta Volonteri’s pioneering work on direct-collapse supermassive black holes. And of course, I’m building on the legacy of countless astronomers; far too many to list here individually. (Thank you, thank you, thank you!)So, that was the background – both the science and the sociology, because both are important if you’re to fully understand the peculiar situation we are in.Here’s the theory.THE BLOWTORCH THEORY OF STRUCTURE FORMATIONI’m calling it the Blowtorch Theory, because new theories need a punchy name to break into the broader conversation. (But, if you’d be more comfortable with something respectably scientific-sounding, feel free to call it the Directed Plasma Overpressure Model, or the Localized Radiative Jet Confluence Hypothesis, or some other bullshit no one will remember.)It starts with two observations.The first: every one of the trillion or so galaxies in our universe that’s big enough or near enough for us to observe closely, appears to have asupermassive black holeat its center, with masses ranging from millions to billions of times that of our sun. And they have a power-law-like distribution: a few of the bigger ones, lots of the smaller ones.The second: theCosmic Microwave Background Radiation—the light emitted by all that hot gas shortly after the Big Bang—is incredibly smooth. We know that the only density fluctuations in that gas are very subtle, less than 0.001%: we think they come from early quantum events, blown up vastly in size by inflation since the Big Bang. These density fluctuations occur at all scales, and have a power-law-like distribution: a few big ones, lots of smaller ones. Oh, and at the range of scales that would match the volumes of gas required to make the earliest, and therefore smallest, versions of all those supermassive black holes (they'll grow in size later), there are, to a very rough approximation – to within an order of magnitude – around a trillion of them.Let's put those together.Now, the smoothness of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation shows that the initial gas cloud in the early universe was much too smooth for easy star formation. (You need small, dense, pockets of gas in order to form stars.) This is a problem for the current, mainstream, bottom-up theories of star formation and galaxy formation, which start with the formation of scattered individual stars, somehow, from this smooth gas.But this smoothness (with its occasional large-but-subtle, not small-and-extreme, density variations) is actually ideal for direct-collapse supermassive black hole formation. When the smooth gas cloud collapses across the entire large-but-subtle density fluctuation, there are no local, small, dense pockets that could otherwise break up into stars. It’s this smoothness which allows the entire vast field of gas to collapse directly into a single supermassive black hole.And so blowtorch theory argues that all of these supermassive black holes must form now, inside the first hundred million years, and almost certainly within the first 50 million after the Big Bang. And they must form by direct collapse, semi-simultaneously, in a rapid, abrupt phase transition from what was, until then, an ultrasmooth cloud of gas.AN OBJECTION CONSIDEREDA perfectly understandable mainstream objection would be that the fluctuations are far too subtle, too small – just 0.001%! – to trigger such a direct collapse of such a large area of gas. My argument, however, is that the conditions in the early universe are fine-tuned so that such fluctuations nonethelessdotrigger such collapses, at a specific point in the expansion of the smooth gas.I do understand mainstream resistance to this kind of argument-by-consequences, which can seem lacking in rigour. But please note that, similarly, in 1953, the British astronomerFred Hoyle, using precisely this logic, predicted a highly unlikely resonance frequency in the carbon-12 atom, that would allow for the extremely efficient, complex (and unlikely) fusion mechanism of thetriple-alpha process(where, deep inside a star, three helium-4 nuclei – alpha particles – are turned into carbon). He didn't predict this usingmathematicallogic: he predicted it because, when he looked around our universe, he saw a shit-ton of carbon everywhere, and it had to come fromsomewhere. Fusing three helium nuclei would do it, however unlikely that seemed. Hoyle had to urge his more cautious colleague, the nuclear astrophysicistWilliam A. Fowler, to look for the necessary resonance. Grumbling, Fowler looked. And found it. (Amusingly, Fowler got a Nobel for this, in 1983; Fred, who had actually come up with the idea, didn’t, partly because he had annoyed too many people with some of his other, sillier ideas. Yes, I am aware that it’s a thin line between genius and just being spectacularly wrong! But walking that line is where all the fun is to be had…)Similarly, in 1982,Dan Shechtmandiscoveredquasicrystalswith non-repeating, five-fold (or ten-fold) rotational symmetries were possible. This did not just require an unlikely level of fine-tuning: it was explicitly ruled out by the established laws of crystallography at the time. His paper was repeatedly rejected, the head of his lab told him to “go read the textbook,” then asked him to leave the research group for “bringing disgrace” on the team. When the paper was finally published, two years later, the most famous chemist in the world,Linus Paulingpissed all over him, saying, “There is no such thing as quasicrystals, only quasi-scientists.” But, when people finally actually looked, they discovered Shechtman was right. (He got an apologetic Nobel in 2011.) And the aperiodic, yet ordered, structures he discovered have novel mechanical, thermal, and photonic properties that classical crystals lack. Again, a highly unlikely level of fine-tuning that allowed for a complex outcome turned out to be true.I predict it will, again, here, for reasons that will soon become clear.COBE, launched in 1989, took the first, crude survey of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. Red is hotter, blue is colder, but not by much: variations of just 1 in 100,000. Those temperature contrasts indicate density contrasts. CREDIT: NASA/COBE Science TeamThis is WMAP’s more detailed map of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation across the full sky. WMAP launched in 2001, and took nine years to get all the data here. It shows you the temperature (and thus density) of the cloud from which, I’ll argue, a trillion supermassive black holes are about to condense. Umbrellas up! CREDIT: NASA/WMAP Science TeamPHASE TRANSITIONThe ultrasmooth gas, expanding after the Big Bang, resembles a supersaturated cloud, which on a hot summer’s day can transition extremely rapidly from not-a-single-raindrop to a torrential shower, comprising millions of drops, all produced semi-simultaneously.As the smoothness of the gas ensures nearly uniform conditions across the early universe, and as the subtle density variations are very thoroughly distributed across the universe, many regions should hit the critical threshold at the same time. In thatphase transition, you should therefore see multiple, semi-simultaneous direct collapses—just like rain abruptly beginning in many spots within a saturated cloud.It's likely that the shockwave from each of those initial direct collapses would compress nearby gas, pushing it past the collapse threshold, and thus setting off further collapses, in a cascading wave.So you would see chain reactions in many localised regions, till they all meet – rather as, say, crystallisation spreads during the phase transition from water to ice.WHY MUST ALL THE SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES FORM EARLY?The supermassive black holes all need to form together, now, at this early stage, from the smooth gas, because they won’t be able to later. Why? The gas will no longer be smooth enough—because these new, massive black holes are about to fuck up that smoooooooooth gas real good.Jet from a nearby galaxy called Centaurus A, about 12 million light-years from Earth. CREDIT: NASA/CXC/SAO/D. Bogensberger et al; Image Processing: NASA/CXC/SAO/N. Wolk;SWITCHING ON THE BLOWTORCHRemember, each supermassive black hole starts with a mass of tens or hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, even hundreds of millions of suns, depending on the size of the fluctuation that triggered it. (The bigger ones are much less numerous. But they’ll all grow larger than this, later, as they eat more gas, and as some galaxies merge.) This intense concentration of mass begins to gravitationally attract enormous quantities of gas.Why doesn't this gas orbit the black hole endlessly, and frictionlessly, like planets orbit stars? Because the shock of the collapse has ionized some of the surrounding gas, into positive protons and negative electrons. This ionized state makes it an electrically-charged plasma, generating electromagnetic fields and currents that cause turbulence. As the American astrophysicistSteven Balbusand his colleagueJohn Hawleyworked outin 1991, this turbulence acts as a remarkably efficient magnetic brake, transferring the plasma’s angular momentum outward, allowing the plasma itself to move rapidly inward, closer and hotter, forming a ferociously hot accretion disc—a blazing donut—locked tightly around the black hole. Some gas falls into the small mouth of the (dense, but tiny) black hole, bulking it up, but most of the gas just spirals closer for now, getting ludicrously hot from magnetic reconnection events (rather than mere particle-to-particle friction). Basically, a huge, hot, increasingly frantic queue builds up outside the exclusive, narrow, VIP entrance to the black hole.“And the amazing thing is that even a very weak magnetic field would be enough to completely disrupt the stability properties of the gas. And that's what a lot of people had a hard time getting their head around.”–Steven Balbus, co-discoverer of the magnetorotational instability. (Also known as the Balbus–Hawley instability.)(Yes, yet another example of the Fred Hoyle / Dan Shechtman phenomenon. Evolved systems turn out to be extremely fine-tuned, at the level of the basic parameters of matter, so as to enable unlikely outcomes that lead to complex processes and structures…)THE DYNAMOS POWER UPMeanwhile, conservation of angular momentum means all the rotational energy of the initial vast, smooth cloud of gas is now concentrated into the much smaller black hole. (It’ssupermassive, but it’s notbig; millions of times the mass of our sun, all now crammed into a space far smaller than our solar system.)This concentration forces the supermassive black hole to spin ridiculously rapidly, at close to its absolute maximum theoretical limit (so, pretty close to the speed of light), at the core of a hot, dense cloud of charged particles, the closest of which are now also spinning at nearly lightspeed. The whole system becomes a colossal dynamo, generating an absurdly powerful magnetic field from the rotating plasma.This magnetic field now blasts two jets of hyper-energetic charged particles from the black hole’s poles: one north, one south. The dynamo electromagnetically accelerates these particles to almost light speed. (There goes all that shed angular momentum!) As they move this fast, you see relativistic effects—time dilates, particle masses increase relative to some guy watching from far away, all the fun stuff predicted by Einstein’s General Relativity. (Hence, “relativistic jets.”)The jet is also collimated, meaning it stays coherent and narrow as it beams into the surrounding gas. They still can’t fully EXPLAIN how it remains so tightly collimated over such long distances; theory saysKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities—turbulence, basically—should cause it to break up. But the further away in space they look (and thus the further back in time), the more the mainstream theory fails: Porphyrion,the 23-million-light-years-long jet described recently in Natureis, after all, 40% longer than theory said was possible. Yet again, fine-tuning means that highly unlikely orderly structure emerges from what a naive, everything-is-arbitrary, approach assumes should be random chaos. (Detect a theme?)So, what does this tightly-focused, high-speed jet of charged particles do? A lot. It first sheds angular momentum from the hot gas “donut” around the black hole, stopping the donut from disintegrating and allowing more gas to fall in. But I’ll focus on the three most important later structural impacts of these jets: galaxy formation, void formation, and magnetic field formation (in galaxies, filaments, and voids).1.) Galaxy FormationImmediately surrounding the supermassive black hole is a hot, tight, fast-spinning donut of ionized gas. Further out lies a much larger, cooler, slower sphere of smooth gas, which has been drawn in by gravity. As it moves closer, this gas speeds up (thanks to conservation of angular momentum) and begins to flatten out into a much thinner, denser, disc. (Yeah, Zeldovich’s dear old pancake again.) The relativistic jet from the black hole blasts through this disc like a bullet through a water balloon, sending out pressure waves that disrupt the smoothness of the gas, causing pockets of density—and thus star formation. This cascade of star formation builds a tight, compact galaxy around the supermassive black hole.Ipredicted this process in more detail two years ago, before the James Webb Space Telescope released its first data. (And I was right.) I won’t recap here, as I want to focus on the other two important structural consequences: void formation and magnetic fields.2.) Void FormationMany of these early relativistic jets just keep on going, reaching distances ten times, a hundred times, longer than the width of the galaxy forming at their base. And remember, I’m arguing that there's very roughly a trillion of these jets, in assorted sizes, nicely spaced out. As they streak through the pristine gas of the early universe at close to light speed, the jets generate massive shockwaves that push matter out of 80% of the universe.This is not fanciful. We know that, when fed gas, supermassive black holes fire jets from both magnetic poles. We know that, over time, these jets form huge, low-pressure cavities in the gas north and south of their galaxy. We see evidence of such lobes today—like theFermi bubbles(which we only discovered in 2010), north and south of our own Milky Way galaxy, probably caused recently by a brief firing of jets from our galaxy’s own supermassive black hole (as some gas, or a star, fell in).The enormous Fermi Bubbles, blown in the gas north and south of our own Milky Way galaxy, that we only spotted in 2010. (This is an illustration, obviously, not a photo.) Credit: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight CenterWe know that older cavities tend to be larger, because they formed when gas in the vicinity of the supermassive black holes was denser and more plentiful, providing the fuel for longer, more powerful jets. (For example,a marvellous 2024 paperbyFrancesco Ubertosi,Simona Giacintucci,Tracy Clarkeet al, on galaxy cluster Abell 496, shows cavities within cavities within cavities, with the oldest being the largest.)My prediction here is that the dense gas of the early universe feeds sustained, powerful jets, which generate vast, early cavities that continue expanding, eventually detaching from their jet source (which eventually runs out of fuel, and switches off). These cavities, formed by an electromagnetic jet, will have (I’m arguing) a weak but effective electromagnetic boundary – rather like a soap bubble’s skin – so when they encounter other cavities, their electromagnetic skins could simply merge, forming larger voids. The universe’s expansion should then hugely expand them over time.Blowtorch theory arguesthatis what generated today’s voids, with their blurry balloon-animal shapes.A trillion dynamos, switching on a trillion blowtorches,early.A still image taken from a CosmicFlows-4 data visualisation video,Basins of Attraction in the Local Universe(Credit: Daniel Pomarède). This image shows “basins of attraction” – regions where gravity is pulling in galaxies and gas. The colourless regions, without much matter, are voids. But what do they look like? BALLOON ANIMALS, right? CREDIT:In pushing gas out of 80% of the universe, these jets are building dense gas reservoirs in the remaining 20%: the narrow spaces, or filaments, between voids. Reservoirs the galaxies will draw on later, using thethirdthing the electromagnetic jets are building. Something they are particularly suited to…3.) Electromagnetic Fields! (and thus Filament Formation!)The electromagnetic jets in this high-powered, early era—jets sometimes ten, fifty, even a hundred times longer than the galaxy at their base—are also laying down an electromagnetic circulatory system. This is important: Lay down magnetic field lines early enough, and you constrain the future development of the entire universe.MAGNETIC FIELDS CONSTRAIN AND GUIDE IONISED GASHere’s why. Magnetic fields constrain and guide ionized gas (plasma). Within a magnetic field, plasma can’t move freely in all directions: it moves much more easily along magnetic field lines than across them. Processes like heat conduction, viscosity, and diffusion also become highly directional in a magnetic field. So, movement, heat distribution, energy flow—everything in a magnetic field follows the path of least resistance along those field lines.In this way, magnetic fields act like tram tracks for charged particles (or arteries, if you’d prefer a 3D analogy), organizing the energy flow, and mass flow, that structures the system.“Anytime astronomers figure out a new way of looking for magnetic fields in ever more remote regions of the cosmos, inexplicably, they find them.”—Natalie Wolchover, Quanta Magazine, from The Hidden Magnetic Universe Begins to Come Into View, July 2020.True, though I’d remove the word “inexplicably.”EXPLAINING MAGNETIC FIELDS IN VOIDSWe recently discovered that even voids contain faint electromagnetic fields. Currently there is no generally accepted theory for how those fields got there. Blowtorch theory argues that they were left by the jets that sculpted the voids.EXPLAINING MAGNETIC FIELDS IN FILAMENTSThe magnetic fields in the filaments connecting denser regions? Those are the electromagnetic ghosts of the original ultra-powerful, ultra-long jets. Basically, electromagnetic pipes. Their field lines link back to the centers of the galaxies that produced them, establishing a cosmic plumbing system that will, over time, drip-feed back to those galaxies the gas they previously pushed away into dense reservoirs.EXPLAINING THE ABRUPTNESS OF THE DENSITY GRADIENTSThis also explains the abrupt tenfold change in density between filament and void. (Which is a major problem for Lambda Cold Dark Matter.) Without electromagnetic containment, gravity alone should, over time, simply blur out this abrupt density transition. Gravity drops off smoothly with distance, not abruptly, by an order of magnitude, at a specific point. Similarly, gas, even in open space, should slowly diffuse from high-pressure areas to low. Yet that, too, does not seem to be happening to the extent that a purely gravitational theory predicts. The maintenance of such hard boundaries over billions of years makes perfect sense, electromagnetically: it doesn't make any sense gravitationally (with or without dark matter).However, I don’t want to give you the impression this whole process is ultra-efficient, with totally clearcut boundaries. The formation of galaxies, voids, and filaments is messy (as processes evolved through blind Darwinian evolution tend to be); galaxies crash into each other, some gas gets stranded, filaments combine, and tangle. It’s more likeDarwin’s entangled bankthan a smoothly operating machine.But that’s fine, because, from evolution’s point of view (and I'll expand on this shortly), the important thing is to get the gas movingnow, and to lay down magnetic field lines that can capture it and direct that movement. Galaxies are hurriedly laying cable, laying pipes, building reservoirs and filling them, while everything is still close together; while it is still easy. (Just as an embryo grows its arteries and veins while still in utero.)Once in place, these magnetic field lines essentially “freeze” into the plasma. As the universe expands, the field lines thus stretch and expand along with the plasma itself (albeit weakening due to flux conservation).SOPHISTICATED, POWERFUL, EARLY, ELECTROMAGNETIC STRUCTURE FORMATIONThe key point: Early structure formation in our universe is primarily electromagnetic, not gravitational. Gravity does the grunt work of pulling (particularly pulling together the clusters and superclusters), but electromagnetism does the sophisticated work of shaping and directing.And, note, this model needs only baryonic matter—the stuff we can see. No dark matter required. (You can leave it in the picture if you wish, but why? It isn’t necessary.)There will be a couple of obvious questions, so let me answer them here.Q: But the voids we see today are up to a hundred million light-years wide, or even larger! And the jets we see today are far smaller than that, peaking at a few million light-years in length! So how can such small jets make such large voids?A:Because those voids were madeearly, when the universe was still extremely dense and compact. At redshift 20 – roughly 180 million years after the Big Bang – our universe was 20 times smaller in diameter than it is now, with gas therefore nearly 9,300 times denser. (The average density of matter in the universe scales as the cube of the inverse of the scale factor – or, less technically, if you shrink the universe in all three dimensions, you squeeze the living fuck out of the matter.)By redshift 10 – or 500 million years after the Big Bang – the universe was still 10 times smaller, and gas was 1,300 times denser than today. So those early jets didn’t need to travel vast distances to have massive effects. Jets were pushing between a thousand and ten thousand times as much gas out of the way as they would over a similar distance today. And, over time, the universe’s expansion would make these early voids ten or twenty times longer, and wider, and taller – and thus thousands of times larger in volume – than they were at redshift 10 or 20… but they began relatively compact.Moreover, there was much more, and much denser, gas in close proximity to supermassive black holes in the early universe. Enough available gas to feed their dynamos, and thus sustain long, powerful jets, over extended periods—tens or even hundreds of millions of years; far longer than what we see today in our vastly expanded, far more diffuse cosmos.As in most evolved systems, key structures form remarkably early, while it’s still easy. A human embryo, for example, has decided which end will eventually be head, and which feet, by day five, when it’s a mere 64-cell blob, less than 0.2 millimetres in diameter. Likewise with our universe.Q: But if the jets from the core of the new galaxy push gas out of the voids, why don't they also push gas out of the galaxy, switching off star formation?A:Because this is a complex, evolved system doing a complex, evolved job. The same dynamo effect that drives gas away from the galaxy’s poles (perpendicular to its disk) is simultaneously, by removing angular momentum from the gas at its equator, allowing that gas to spiral rapidly inward, forming new stars and feeding the jet. Gravity, electromagnetic fields, and pressure gradients combine to create a vast cosmic pump, steadily drawing in fresh gas. This pump can operate continuously for tens or even hundreds of millions of years.Currently, the mainstream theory is, indeed, that jets quench star formation by driving gas out of the galaxy. But that view came from observing mature, relatively nearby galaxies, many billions of years after the Big Bang, where these pumps are older, erratic, running out of fuel, and beginning to switch off, coinciding with the end of rapid star formation. Correlation; not causation. Meanwhile, pre-James Webb Space Telescope, we had no data on the early, high-power phase.What I predicted back in 2022, and what the James Webb is starting to see strong evidence for, is that, early on, these jets do the opposite—they’re driving star formation, not quenching it.Q: You say Blowtorch Theory shows we don't need dark matter. But isn't dark matter required to explain galactic rotation, and disc galaxy stability, and gravitational lensing, and the galactic dynamics of dwarf galaxies, and acoustic peaks in the Cosmic Microwave Background, and the Universal Rotation Curve, and…A:Currently, yes, simply because every outstanding observational problem has dark matter thrown at it, as the only possible explanation. This is partly because dark matter is so fuzzily defined, with so many free parameters, you can massage it to “solve” almost any problem. (Why did your grandmother slowly but steadily move UP the stairs, in defiance of the laws of gravity? Because there was a large halo of dark matter at the top of the stairs, pulling her. See? Problem solved. No need, now, to look for a more complex, evolutionary, dynamic-systems explanation.)I’m not arguing that blowtorch theory also solves all the other outstanding problems currently explained by dark matter. It doesn’t. I’m making a broader point: that an evolved-universe approach will generalise to solve the other outstanding anomalies. They may well all have quite different explanations. But, as with structure formation, the answers are likely to lie in the sophisticated behaviour of the things we can see, not the simplistic behaviour of a thing we can't. By the way, this makes Blowtorch Theory an excellent fit withDavid Wiltshire’sTimescape cosmology. (See his important recent paper,“Solution to the cosmological constant problem”.) Timescape deals with Dark Energy’s contribution to structure formation; Blowtorch Theory deals with Dark Matter’s contribution to structure formation. Indeed, it is quite likely that, as we find better, more sophisticated explanations for each of these different anomalies, dark matter will slowly fade away, without any big “eureka!” moment. (Or whatever the negative of “eureka!” is.)DARK MATTER IS THE MODERN MIASMAThis is a classic example of theSingle Variable Fallacy, or maybe better The One-Missing-Piece Illusion. A very human cognitive shortcut that assumes there must be a single missing factor that can explain all discrepancies. We made this mistake before, when we blamed all disease on “miasma” – also known as “bad air” and “night air”. “Miasma” almost-but-not-quite explained everything. (The Black Death! Cholera! Chlamydia! Malaria, whose name literally means bad air in Medieval Italian! Oh, and obesity was caused by inhaling the odor of food…)“Miasma” was the dominant theory of disease, worldwide, fortwo thousand years, until the late 19thcentury. But the actual answer to “what causes disease?” involved bacteria, and viruses; airborne transmission, and water transmission; vitamin deficiencies, and food spoilage; some bugs growing in the presence of oxygen, some in the absence of oxygen; mosquitos, and fleas; immune system responses, including both under-reactions and over-reactions – and on and on… In other words, we hadn’t remotely explored the behavioural possibility space of the air and water and food we could see. A special, extra kind of air to one-shot all the problems was not required.Likewise, today, the idea that we havecompletely explored the possibility spaceoccupied by baryonic matter, and must instead postulate an entirely new, and totally invisible, form of matter to explain baryonic matter’s behaviour… you can see the absurdity, right? You can see that we are making precisely the same mistake?Evolved biological systems are complex, and self-organising. Their behaviours feature emergent properties, feedback loops, and interactions across multiple scales. If our universe is itself an evolved system, then it's unsurprising that we're making exactly the same mistake, trying to explain its complex emergent properties using linear causal thinking. Evolved systems resist single-cause explanations. Their behaviors emerge and adjust as the rolling result of weird, unpredictable, interacting networks.Right now, cosmology suffers from a lethal combination of factors – it has baked ΛCDM into every simulation; it uses it as a background assumption that now underlies, and distorts, every paper in astronomy; and it insists that any alternative solution explainevery outstanding observational anomaly in one go, single puzzle-piece style – or if you prefer, miasma-style. This fatal triple-combo has crippled the field’s ability to self-correct.And again, let me emphasise:whether or not dark matter exists,blowtorch theory clearly explains many phenomena, in the specific area of early structure formation, which that theory cannot.WHAT’S NEW, PUSSYCAT?So – for those unfamiliar with the field – what’s novel, and what’s not, in this theory?Not novel: Supermassive black holes exist at the centers of galaxies, some with accretion disks that emit relativistic jets. That’s now mainstream cosmology.Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs),quasars,blazars,Seyfert Galaxies,Fanaroff-Riley Radio Galaxies– all these powerful, inexplicable phenomena eventually turned out to be supermassive black holes, doing things with jets. (Hey, it’s almost as if these black holes, and their jets, might be ubiquitous and important!)What’s novel in my theory is the idea that all the supermassive black holes must form first, by direct collapse – before galaxies form, and indeed before there’s any significant number of stars, or (probably) any stars at all. (This emerges directly from the application of Darwinian evolutionary logic to universes. It’s not predicted by any other theory, and if I’m wrong, my theory wobbles badly and a wheel falls off. So the theory is falsifiable. But the evidence from the James Webb Space Telescope so far is very, very encouraging.) Yes, this phase transition occurs incredibly early and activates many powerful, sustained, directional jets very strongly, very quickly. But – no new physics are needed to explain it. In fact, Priya Natarajan, Volker Bromm, Marta Volonteri, and others showed 18 years ago that direct-collapse supermassive black holes are mathematically possible, in brilliant work that was largely ignored at the time. (They, too, will get a late, apologetic Nobel Prize.)So that's blowtorch theory. But it emerges from – it is both predicted by, and explained by – a larger theory about the universe: three-stage cosmological natural selection. Yes, a theory in desperate need of a shorter, slangier, more vivid, less abstract name. (I find myself calling it the Eggiverse theory – in opposition to the mainstream’s Rockiverse – because it describes our evolved universe rapidly developing upward in complexity over time, like an egg, rather than simply disintegrating slowly, like a rock.)And three-stage cosmological natural selection – Eggiverse theory – builds on Lee Smolin’s original version ofcosmological natural selection.BACKGROUND: LEE SMOLIN’S ORIGINAL THEORY OF COSMOLOGICAL NATURAL SELECTION (DRAWING ON JOHN WHEELER)A quick recap for new readers…Cosmological natural selection assumes that universes reproduce via black holes and big bangs. How? A large mass in a parent universe collapses under its own gravity to form a black hole singularity – an infinitesimal point – that then “bounces”, in a Big Bang, to form a new, expanding, separate bubble of spacetime: a child universe, that exists outside of, and separate from, the parent universe. (The expansion of our own universe since the Big Bang is simply the growth and development to maturity of such a child universe.) If each new universe varies slightly in the fundamental parameters of matter (things like the mass of the electron, or the strength of the strong nuclear force), this will lead to that universe producing either more or fewer black holes, and thus to greater or lesser reproductive success. Over time, this reproduction-with-variation-and-inheritance leads to a Darwinian evolution of universes.There are analogies with biological evolution: changes in the basic parameters of matter between parent and child universe act like the changes in DNA between biological parents and children: any such variations, or mutations, in the basic parameters of matter will lead to changes in the phenotype of the child universe. (Let’s call it the cosmotype.)An evolved universe, therefore, constructs itself according to an internal, evolved set of rules baked deep into its matter, just as a baby, or a sprouting acorn, does.The development of our specific universe, therefore, since its birth in the Big Bang, mirrors the development of an organism; both are complex evolved systems, where (to quote the splendidViscount Ilya Romanovich Prigogine), the energy that moves through the system organises the system.But universes have an interesting reproductive advantage over, say, animals.We know that in our own universe, the (positive) mass energy of matter and its (negative) gravitational energy net out to zero. But that means the amount of energy required to build a universe like ours is essentially… well, none. (SeeLaurence Krauss’s book,A Universe from Nothing; orStephen HawkingandJames Hartle’s 1983 paper,The Wave Function of the Universe, and Hawking’s later book withLeonard Mlodinow,The Grand Design, etc.) Child universes are therefore effectively free to produce. Thus, over time, evolution will favor making more (and smaller) black holes from the same amount of matter. Yes, the black holes will get smaller – but the universes they give birth to, through Big Bangs, will still be full sized. And universes aren’t constrained by a shared environment with limited resources – newborn universes aren’t all competing in a valley with a limited amount of grass. Indeed, each new universe is entirely self-contained and self-sufficient, being both organism and environment – it supplies its own energy for its own development, efficiently and frugally, through stellar fusion, gravitational collapse, et cetera. This means evolution should ultimately favour runaway black hole production. (And that checks out:in the most recent estimate, in 2022, by a team from the International School of Advanced Studies in Trieste, our universe was estimated to have already generated up to a trillion supermassive black holes – and 40 quintillion stellar-collapse black holes.)A key implication of all these assumptions (which I first pointed out on July 8th2022– this theory is undergoing rapid development!), is that direct-collapse supermassive black holes must have been the reproductive mechanism for the earliest, most primitive universes. Primitive universes, like early prokaryotic bacteria, reproduced and nothing else—no complex structures, just straightforward reproduction.This is a simple black hole/big bang reproductive cycle. Or, if you like, a (contracting) black hole to (expanding) white hole cycle.Therefore, the mass-energy—the primitive matter—expanding from a Big Bang in an early universe would have quickly collapsed back into a small number of extremely large black holes (supermassive or even ultramassive), without forming stars, galaxies, planets, or even complex elements. Those things all evolved much later along the evolutionary timeline that eventually led to our universe.Such a basic, ancient reproductive strategy would be conserved by evolution, for the obvious reason that any universes that failed to do this – reproduce – would, in evolutionary terms, die out. (That is, such sterile universes would continue, individually, to exist, growing endlessly older inside their own individual bubble of space-time, but would have no offspring.) Similarly, humans, although far more complex than our jawless fish ancestors, still reproduce as they originally did, by fertilizing an egg – a fundamental reproductive strategy necessarily conserved by evolution.These conserved, direct collapse,supermassiveblack holes are, in several important ways, nothing like the, far more common, stellar-mass black holes we also find in our universe (which form when a large star runs out of fuel and collapses under its own gravity). Supermassive black holes are hundreds of thousands, millions, or even billions of times more massive than stellar-mass black holes; I argue that they must have a completely different formation mechanism (direct collapse); and, as we have seen, they perform totally different, and vital, functions in structuring the early universe.Clearly seeing these differences is vital to understanding our universe.Yet, for decades, mainstream cosmology (trapped inside Lambda Cold Dark Matter, a paradigm that only allowed for bottom-up structure formation) simply ignored the possibility of direct-collapse supermassive black holes. Instead they argued that the supermassive black holes we kept finding at the centre of galaxies were just a bunch of stellar-mass black holes in a trenchcoat. That the first stars must have been large; formed large stellar-collapse black holes; these quickly merged, and merged again, and again, then happened to drift to the galactic centre thanks to gravity, and then drank in huge amounts of gas. (Yeah, more random, arbitrary, bottom-up structure formation.)Voilà, an accidental, late-to-form, supermassive black hole…But, as our ever-improving telescopes get us more and more data, from earlier and earlier, it gets harder and harder to make the maths add up. We are now able to observe supermassive black holesshockingly close to the Big Bang, when the universe was just 3% of its current age. There simply isn’t enough time for them to have formed from lots of smaller stellar-mass black hole mergers.And so the supermassive black holes in our universe today presumably formed the same way as in our distant ancestral universes: by direct collapse of a massive, smooth gas cloud – without needing to build stars first – very soon after the Big Bang.But why isn't our universe still fine-tuned by evolution to turnallits gas into supermassive black holes immediately after the Big Bang? Because, over time, it evolved a new, sophisticated, multi-stage reproductive cycle that takes billions of years. There are many analogies for this in biology; we know this is what evolution does. Primitive bacteria, for example, reproduce a single all-purpose cell in 20 minutes; complex beings like humans reproducetrillionsof specialised cells, in a more complex process that takes decades. Both are successful, but in their own evolutionary contexts.So here, the unit of selection isn’t a single galaxy; it’s the entire universe – a trillion galaxies contained within a single, expanding membrane of spacetime, like the trillions of cells contained by a human’s skin. And what matters is reproduction (black hole production) over its full lifespan.THAT THIRTEEN-SYLLABLE THEORY AGAINTIMELINE:To fully understand this, you’ll need the three-stage model of cosmological natural selection. (Good old Eggiverse theory.)1990s:Smolin’s original theory was a limited, single-stage model because, back then, it was still assumed all black holes, whatever their size, were made out of stellar-collapse black holes.2000s:Vidal, Smart, Price and Kane expanded this to a two-stage model, adding technologically-produced small black holes. (This explained why evolved universes might generate life – a brilliant conceptual breakthrough, again overlooked at the time.)2020s:I develop the three-stage model, incorporating direct-collapse supermassive black holes – the model which led to blowtorch theory, and which generates the predictions we’re seeing here.A nice, simple, punk-rock-fanzine-style illustration of the three stages of black hole production in our universe, as predicted by three-stage cosmological natural selection.

Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en)THE THREE-STAGE MODEL OF COSMOLOGICAL NATURAL SELECTIONSTAGE 1: DIRECT COLLAPSE SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLESRight at the start, in a phase transition shortly after the big bang, a relatively small number of supermassive black holes quickly form by direct collapse. (Very roughly a trillion, of assorted sizes.)That is the original reproductive mechanism for universes, conserved by evolution.STAGE 2: STELLAR-MASS BLACK HOLESHowever, these supermassive black holes only use up a fraction of the gas in the universe. They then shape and direct much of the remaining gas so as to form galaxies around themselves—one galaxy (containing hundreds of millions to hundreds of billions of stars) per supermassive black hole. These galaxies thus eventually generate many more stellar-mass black holes than the initial set of supermassive ones. (Thus, overall, far more black holes – offspring – per unit mass.) This more complex, highly efficient method of reproduction evolved later in the history of universes and has likewise been conserved, because it leads to…STAGE 3: TECHNOLOGICALLY PRODUCED SMALL BLACK HOLESIn a more sophisticated stage 3 universe, after two or three rounds of star formation, galaxies have built out (through fusion) and distributed (through supernova explosions) the periodic table of all the elements.This allows planets and moons to form around third-round stars like our own sun. (Andstanets and ploons to form in open space… but that’s another story.) Sunshine and/or gravitational energy then drive the development of the complex organic chemistry of biology: Biology is the first half of the periodic table coming to life. Eventually, that life, rapidly self-complexifying on countless billions of habitable worlds per galaxy, attains intelligence and technological ability. (It has swiftly done so on our own perfectly average planet—so we know this happens.) Technology is the second half of the periodic table coming to life. At which point, those intelligent, technology-wielding lifeforms begin creating vast quantities of extremely small black holes for energy production.Biology is the first half of the periodic table coming to life.Technology is the second half of the periodic table coming to life.-Me (trying to boil this whole theory down into t-shirt memes)Q: Why black holes?A:Because you can just chuck any matter at all into them, and they can convert up to 42% of its mass into energy, making them the most efficient energy source in our universe. (And, asmy friend Yogihas pointed out, the most sustainable – you could keep a civilization and its ecosystem alive by this method long after all the uranium’s been used up; indeed, long after all the stars have gone out.) By comparison, nuclear fission converts only 0.1% of mass into energy, and fusion 0.7%. So, any intelligent species optimizing for energy efficiency (and sustainability) will eventually converge on small black hole production. (Optimal size is roughly Mount-Everest-mass.) As the production of countless small black holes by technology-wielding lifeforms means huge reproductive success for that universe, such life will be intensely selected for, and strongly conserved. Most universes along our evolutionary branch should, by now, generate such lifeforms. Again, that’s because such Stage 3 universes will produce, over their lifetime, far more black holes per unit mass than will either Stage 1 or Stage 2 universes.HOW THE BLOWTORCH THEORY MAKES EVOLUTIONARY SENSEThis third reproductive mechanism is far more complex than the first two (it’s more highly evolved!), and it requires the individual universe to have a much longer active lifespan. In particular, it needs multiple rounds of star formation to take place within the individual universe, over billions of years, to build out and distribute the entire periodic table—and thus planets, moons, life, and eventually, technology.If our universe were to use up all its gas early, just to make a few more first-round, low-metallicity stars and simple stellar-mass black holes, we’d never reach this third and most reproductively successful stage.So that pure hydrogen gas left over from the Big Bang has to be carefully rationed and delivered to spiral galaxies over billions of years. But it also needs to be enriched—because you can’t easily make stars out of pure hydrogen and helium alone. You need heavier elements – rather annoyingly dubbed “metals” by astronomers (even when, like nitrogen and oxygen, they’re not metals). In spiral galaxies, first-round stars blow up and distribute these “metals” back into the pure hydrogen that’s streaming in from the filaments. That enriched gas then gathers in the specialised regions in the arms of spiral galaxies we call “stellar nurseries”, ready for the next round of star formation. (Stellarnurseries… Interesting name, huh? I suspect that, at a deep subconscious level, many astronomers already know this is an efficient, evolved, quasi-biological process.)This Hubble photo shows a stellar nursery getting ripped apart by radiation from a nearby large star. You can see baby stars forming in the murk of gas and dust. CREDIT:NASAand Jeff Hester (Arizona State University)So spiral galaxies can store, channel, enrich, and drip-feed this primal hydrogen gas back to their stellar nurseries, where carbon and oxygen from past supernovae help refrigerate it (and enrich it), allowing it to collapse to form next-round stars. This absurdly intricate process is driven by the delicately balanced interplay of gravitational and electromagnetic forces. It’s clearly a fine-tuned system, evolved for optimal star-planet-moon-life-technology creation. Why “clearly fine-tuned?” Because such a result is unbelievably unlikely – yet, look around you,that's what it does. (Just as Fred Hoyle predicted that the fusion process in stars was fine-tuned to produce and distribute the elements – because look around you,that's what it does.)EXCEPTIONS PROVE RULES: ELLIPTICAL GALAXIESBut let’s take a quick look atelliptical galaxies. These are 10-15% of all galaxies, with roughly spherical shapes, intense but early star formation – and long-term struggles to replenish their gas. Lacking the intricate gas management system of spiral galaxies, ellipticals burn out quickly, typically failing to form the large amounts of the full suite of elements essential for planets, life, and tech. Ellipticals make SOME elements, and distribute them, obviously, as their larger stars run out of fuel and blow up as supernovae – but they don’t go through multiple rounds of star formation, over billions of years, methodically building out ever-greater amounts of heavier elements by recycling and refining them, in the way spirals do. And yes, some ellipticals are still active, as other galaxies crash into them, bringing fresh gas – but most are red and dead.So what’s the story with ellipticals? Well, let me speculate: if our universe is the result of the evolutionary process I outlined above, then they’re probably the vestiges of an earlier cosmic age, like our own vestigial tailbone, or the fur in our armpits. All galaxies would've been ellipticals (or similar) at Stage Two, when only rapid star-making mattered. (Ellipticals are brilliant at extremely rapid star-making!)EVOLUTIONARY TRACES: TAU, MUON, ELECTRONEvolution moves on, but it drags elements of its evolutionary past around with it, it can’t simply make a clean break. Similarly, the three-stage model of cosmological natural selection explains why three kinds of electron can be produced in our universe – but only one usually is, under normal conditions.Extremely heavy tau electrons(roughly 3,500 times the mass of a normal electron), andheavy muons(roughly 200 times heavier), are presumably fossil particles from stage one and stage two respectively. (Interestingly, the Nobel-Prize-winning Japanese physicistYoichiro Nambuintuited this as far back as 1985, in his wonderful essayDirections of Particle Physics, but had no theory to explain it.) Just to make it clear, this is much more speculative than the theory it’s based on. But it’s a speculation I find intriguing, and you might find interesting.Evolutionary Stage 1:An extremely heavy electron (the tau) made evolutionary sense when all you had to do was maximise immediate direct-collapse black holes. Mass was king! The positive and negative particles probably had roughly the same mass back then, but it didn’t matter; they weren’t building anything complicated.Evolutionary Stage 2:A less heavy (but still pretty heavy!) electron (the muon) would have been ideal if you still needed to make some supermassive black holes, but were now optimising for, more numerous, stellar-collapse black holes. You only needed to be able to make a couple of primitive elements, through primitive fusion.And Evolutionary Stage 3:Our modern, lightweight electron was the evolutionary breakthrough that allowed the assembly, by fusion, of many more (more complex) elements, and thus complex chemistry, life, and technology – optimising for FAR more numerous technologically-produced black holes…All universes, like all biological DNA-based organisms, are forever a little messy; forever transitional between what they once were, and what they might yet be.For example, the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen that originally evolved to drive efficient stellar fusion in Stage 2 universes,through the CNO cycle, were laterexapted(adapted for a new purpose by evolution) as the basis for biological life in Stage 3 universes.Likewise, just look through a telescope, and you can see handfuls of the red-and-dead elliptical galaxies that must have dominated those Stage 2 universes.Fire up a particle accelerator, and you can bring to life ghost particles like the tau and muon, still implicit in our quantum fields, even though they have long been banished from our everyday world by the ongoing evolution of the other parameters of matter.Those traces of our evolutionary past, embedded in our present, mean that we can trace the evolutionary history of universes, even though we only have a single specimen to examine – the universe we are embedded inside, that we are part of. The universe that recently generated us, as part of its developmental process. The universe that is coming to know itself through us; act on itself through us. The universe in which we are currently helping sand to think.Not black holes. A 12” and a 6” silicon wafer, forming extremely shiny black mirrors. Silicon is the second most common element in the Earth’s crust, after oxygen – a fact which may give us a glimpse of our future. Silicon chips are made from these wafers, as we teach sand how to think. CREDIT:HebbeatGerman Wikipedia. Public domain.Okay. AsTyler Cowengently pointed out to me, when I showed him an earlier draft of this, a good theory makes predictions.So here are some.PREDICTIONSSupermassive black holes form first, in a phase change that precedes stars and galaxiesWe will see a wave of direct collapse supermassive black hole formation (numbering a trillion or so), well inside the first 100 million years after the Big Bang. (And almost certainly inside the first fifty million.) This wave precedes star and galaxy formation.Those early supermassive black holes will be found to spin at close to the Kerr limitAs all the angular momentum in the entire vast cloud is conserved, the spin rate of these direct collapse supermassive black holes will approach the Kerr black hole spin limit (very close to the speed of light). Later mergers, plus infills of randomly oriented gas and stars, etc, will often lower that spin rate, making them less efficient: but they are born at close to maximum efficiency.Those extremely fast-spinning, efficient supermassive black holes then generate stars and galaxiesIt is the supermassive black holes which generate the galaxies around themselves, by attracting, shocking, and enriching the surrounding gas to precipitate waves of star formation.Meanwhile, they generate the cosmic webA trillion quasars switch on immediately, blasting out powerful, sustained relativistic jets, which create both the low-pressure, lightly-magnetized cavities and the high-pressure, highly-magnetized pipes that merge and expand to form the voids and filaments of the cosmic web.But it’s simply hard to see anything at all from the first fifty million years after the Big Bang, let alone the detailed picture I’ve just described – even with the James Webb Space Telescope. So here are some specifics we can look for, using a variety of methods, some available right now:Gravitational waves: The Popcorn SignatureGravitational waves are ripples in spacetime, caused by large masses moving asymmetrically. As our gravitational wave detectors (like the wonderfulPulsar Timing Arrays I wrote about here) grow more sensitive, and able to locate events further and further back in space and time, we will find the gravitational-wave traces of that original brief era of direct collapse supermassive black hole formation coming from all over the sky, in lots of faint, overlapping, low-frequency gravitational waves. It’s true that any initial perfectly symmetrical collapses wouldn’t generate waves (no rough edges = no splash = no ripple), but as the smoothness breaks down, the later, slightly less symmetrical collapses should, as should any early mergers.Being a phase transition, it should take place over a relatively tight period of a few million years (and probably at some point inside the first 50 million years). As such, the overall signal (the combination of all the signals) should have a steep attack; a short, extremely intense peak; and a slightly longer, less steep decay: Pop… pop… poppopPOPPOPPOPpop… pop… pop… … … pop. Rather like the production of a batch of popcorn. Let's call that the Popcorn Signature: The gravitational wave counterpart to the Cosmic Microwave Background.This is just popcorn. I was going to draw a graph of the popcorn signature, but it’s pretty self-explanatory. CREDIT: Borrowed from Wikipedia.

Use Flagstaffotos for all your cosmological popcorn-related photography needs!Speaking of which, I also predict…(Takes a deep breath….)A statistical relationship between cosmic microwave background quantum fluctuations and supermassive black holesIf fluctuations indeed seed direct collapses, there should be a statistical relationship between the range of sizes and relative numbers of the blown-up quantum fluctuations we see in the cosmic microwave background, and the range of sizes and relative numbers of the supermassive black holes we see in the very early universe. (Before any later mergers distort the relationship.) Also…Signatures of chain-reaction collapsesIf the direct collapse of one region of gas can compress neighboring regions into collapse (similar to the raindrop-cascades in clouds here on Earth), we might be able to detect “clustered timing” effects: bursts of supermassive black hole formation in short intervals, slightly offset in space and time as shockwaves push adjacent regions over the collapse threshold. Basically, look for non-random clustering of the earliest quasar ignition, in redshift slices. (“Collapse cascades.”) And…Extremely early, rapid, curved starbursts triggered by jet-driven shocksLook for shock-geometry features in extremely early high-redshift galaxies: arcs, circles, or cones of newly formed stars, in rings that are centred on the active, or recently active, supermassive black hole. There will be more of this the earlier you get. (Later, once the jets switch off, ongoing star formation will occur more frugally in the spiral arms, as the full gas circulatory system establishes itself.)OK, let’s move on to filaments and voids.Uniform field orientation along filamentsIf powerful jets – rather than slow, random, gravitational infall – formed filaments, then we should see highly correlated magnetic field orientations over incredibly long stretches of filament. Not the arbitrary, patchy, turbulent, broken-jig-saw-puzzle fields of a filament randomly assembled by gravity.Rifle barrel filamentsLet me add a twist to that. Additionally, the rapidly spinning central supermassive black hole – because it causes spacetime to rotate at speeds close to the speed of light near the event horizon – should impart a continuous, ongoing twist to the magnetic fieldlines of the jet as it accelerates away. (As first suggestedbyRoger BlandfordandRoman Znajekin 1977, and since confirmed, in 2010, byKeiichi Asadaet al,in a very smart observational paper.) This should result in a helical, or spiral, magnetic field, which stabilises the jet of plasma, leading to less turbulence. (Similarly, the spiral groove which lines a rifle barrel causes the bullet to spin, stabilizing it.)I predict this helical magnetic field – this rifled gun barrel design – will be inherited by the filament, allowing plasma to flow along it more swiftly, and crucially with far less turbulence, than you would expect in a filament randomly assembled by gravity alone.We are already seeing signs that gas is mysteriously low in turbulence while flowing along filaments, only becoming turbulent as it leaves the pipe of the filament and enters the open space of the cluster (the node). See, for a great example, the recenteROSITAX-ray observations of theAbell 3667cluster of galaxies, wherea HUGE filament of gas, feeding into the cluster,​ delivers gas gently, with very low turbulence, until it actually spills out of the filament into the cluster proper, and becomes extremely turbulent.Blowtorch theory explains why. So, look for helical fields in filaments.Weak internal fields in voids, surrounded by stronger bubble-like surface fields, with “seams”A slightly more technical one, but a nice one: If voids are made from the merger (and later expansion) of cavities or bubbles formed early by powerful electromagnetic jets, voids should therefore have weak internal magnetic fields, surrounded by stronger electromagnetic “skins” with bubble-like field topologies. Additionally, we might see thin transition zones, with a different field topology, along the seam where the bubbles meet and merge. (Imagine the lines where the balloon skins meet in a balloon animal.) Very sensitive polarised-light surveys, like theSquare Kilometre Array(SKA), might detect abrupt changes in Faraday rotation across these seams, which should show shell-like or patch-boundary field structures. (Faraday rotation is what happens when polarised light passes through a magnetised plasma: those polarised lightwaves get rotated, and the longer their wavelength, the more they get rotated. So light should be rotated differently either side of the seam... and VERY differently by the seam itself.)Residual shocks along the boundary arcs where bubbles meet and merge might also still be detectable as extremely faint synchrotron or X-ray relics.Cosmic rays might follow filament field funnelsIf filaments are rifled magnetic pipes, they might guide and accelerate some cosmic rays. Future cosmic-ray observatories could look for higher cosmic ray numbers aligned with known filament structures. I predict this will turn out to be the explanation for the unexpected transparency of the universe tovery-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays. They are spending much of their journey being accelerated down the barrel of an electromagnetic cannon.\"I know what you're thinking. You're thinking: 'Did he fire six very-high-energy gamma rays? Or only five?' To tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a filament with a helical magnetic field structure, the ghostly expanded trace of the most powerful electromagnetic jet in the universe, and could blow your head clean off, you gotta ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do you, punk?”—\"Dirty\" Harry Callahan CREDIT:Copyright Warner Bros and other relevant production studios and distributors, and, in the ultimate realm beyond all our earthly senses, perhaps even Satan himself. But, you know, fair use, because parody.Distinct void density profiles and sharp boundariesThis leads to another prediction: the transition between void interior and filament wall should be more abrupt than the gently sloping, radial density gradient any purely gravitational simulation typically produces. (With or without dark matter.) Right now our instruments do not have the resolution to see such a sharp transition, and are assuming, rather than observing, relatively smooth density gradients at the void/filament boundaries. So, more formally (clears throat): blowtorch theory predicts a near step-function slope over a smaller transition zone than ΛCDM-based void analyses.Statistical relationship between supermassive black hole size and adjacent void sizesA rather obvious one, but… Statistically, the larger supermassive black holes should tend to be found at the far ends of the larger voids (along their longer axis), as they generated those voids. (And smaller ones at the far ends of smaller voids, yeah.)Caution: this won't be a simple one-to-one mapping. Contemporary voids are generally formed from the earlier mergers of a number of cavities. Also, bear in mind, later mergers of not just voids, but galaxies, and supermassive black holes – plus spacetime expansion, gravity, and kinematics of all kinds – will make these relationships less obvious over time.OK, that should be enough predictions, even for Tyler.But I’ll just note that the theory also potentially explains a bunch of other puzzling phenomena, such asthe observed large-scale asymmetry in galaxy spin directions, and whyquasar polarisation appears to be coherently aligned over billions of lightyears. (Coherent early processes lead to coherent later outcomes! Also,black holes give birth to spinning universes!)Plus it potentially solves the missing satellites problem, the cusp/core problem, the galaxy rotation problem, and the Hubble tension… I am itching to write another page speculating WILDLY BUT BRILLIANTLY on each of these, but this post is already too long. (Shades ofFermat’s“I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition, which this margin is too narrow to contain”, I know, I know – but subscribe, now, for free, and I’ll email you those posts as I write them.)The Egg And The Rock is a reader-supported publication.

I don’t want to fight you, I want to liberate you. Join me.)But, tragically, after fifty years of development, ΛCDM remains an improvised, incoherent, after-the-fact, ad hoc description of a random bunch of puzzling stuff that, it now turns out, may not even have a common explanation. It’s an infinitely flexible framework, not a predictive theory. When it has madepredictions, they have been consistently proved wrong by observation. Have a couple turned out OK? Sure! (I’ll give you the CMB power spectrum, nice one.) But its overall hit rate is still terrible. In general, most of its predictions have been made in haste, with a bit of parameter tweaking, based on a stream of slowly emerging data, rather than genuinely preceding and predicting that data.ΛCDM hassixfree parameters –total matter density,dark energy density,Hubble constant,amplitude of matter fluctuations,spectral index of initial fluctuations, andoptical depth from re-ionization– and every single one of these has been repeatedly tweaked in the light of emerging new data. That’s fine, that’s what you have to do… but it’s been fifty years now, and the tweaking never stops. There’s simply nothing solid there. Meanwhile, every failure of prediction is immediately rebranded as “an exciting opportunity for new physics!” Ah, new physics. Dark matter, after fifty years, still requires new particles, and their new physics, but can't seem to catch a glimpse of even one. (Recall thatthe Large Hadron Colliderfoundthe Higgs bosonexactly where predicted; but it didn’t find any dark matter, despite exploring all the energy ranges where such stuff was predicted to be.)By contrast, three-stage cosmological natural selection, and the blowtorch theory that emerges from it, is the coherent description of an equally coherent functional complex system. It has already madeextraordinarily successful predictions, sinceconfirmed by observation. Indeed, it has now just made a whole bunch of new predictions, which you can go check on: it is not afraid of being tested, and, unlike ΛCDM, is happy to risk being falsified. It has enormous explanatory power. It requires no new particles and no new physics. Does it need a lot of work, to mathematicize, test, and validate it? Sure! But it’s doing pretty good so far, for a three-year-old theory (based, yes, on an earlier theory that is, itself,only half the age of ΛCDM), developed by a handful of people occasionally talking over coffee, and WhatsApp, with essentially no institutional backing, or funding – particularly when its opponent has had a fifty-year head-start, and all the resources of all the world’s best scientists across every relevant field.There is a story told by the famous physicistVictor (Viki) Weisskopf, which I would like you to read, and really internalise, reallythink about, for a minute, particularly if you work in the fields of cosmology, or astrophysics, or astronomy. (By a poignant coincidence, it takes place at the very observatory from whichStephen GregoryandLaird A. Thompsonfirst discovered voids.)“Several years ago I received an invitation to give a series of lectures at the University of Arizona at Tucson. I was delighted to accept because it would give me a chance to visit theKitts Peak astronomical observatory, which had a very powerful telescope I had always wanted to look through. I asked my hosts to arrange an evening to visit the observatory so I could look directly at some interesting objects through the telescope. But I was told this would be impossible because the telescope was constantly in use for photography and other research activities. There was no time for simply looking at objects. In that case, I replied, I would not be able to come to deliver my talks. Within days I was informed that everything had been arranged according to my wishes. We drove up the mountain on a wonderfully clear night. The stars and the Milky Way glistened intensely and seemed almost close enough to touch. I entered the cupola and told the technicians who ran the computer-activated telescope that I wanted to see Saturn and a number of the galaxies. It was a great pleasure to observe with my own eyes and with the utmost clarity all the details I had only seen on photographs before. As I looked at all that, I realized that the room had begun to fill with people, and one by one they too peeked into the telescope. I was told that these were astronomers attached to the observatory, but they had never before had the opportunity of looking directly at the objects of their investigations.”–Victor Weisskopf, fromThe Joy of Insight.OK, stop reading for a second, and soak that up.(If you didn’t stop; seriously, stop, and soak. Maybe even read it again.)Victor finishes that story with the words,“I can only hope that this encounter made them realize the importance of such direct contacts.”Yeah, me too, Victor. Me too.OK, time to choose.1.)

CREDIT:Yoshiki Okamoto&Akira Yasuda, and I guess CAPCOM.NOW WHAT?So, what can you do about this? Well, this is a classic paradigm shift. So what you can do depends on who you are.If you’re a science journalist: Get in touch. Every article on the early universe, for the past two and a half years, has quoted some scientist saying “Nobody predicted this!” That has to stop. Three-stage cosmological natural selection – dear old Eggiverse theory! – predicted all of this. Let’s get it into the conversation, where it belongs. The reasons for its exclusion have been sociological, not scientific. I realise there are no bad guys here, it’s not a conspiracy. Cosmologists, understandably, don’t have the biology background to apply an evolutionary theory to their work, and evolutionary biologists, understandably, haven’t even heard of a theory at the fringes of cosmology. But that has left it in a knowledge shadow: help me get it out into the light.If you’re a cosmologist, astrophysicist, or astronomer: I need you. (Also! Evolutionary biologists, chemists, geologists, systems scientists: the implications run right through the sciences.) Let’s work together. I’ll be moving to the Bay Area soon, to set up an Evolutionary Cosmology working group of domain experts to develop this theory, and break it into the mainstream. You can think of the working group as...A startup, to disrupt cosmology.A heist team, to crack astrophysics.An Ocean’s 11 for astronomy.Doesn’t that sound more fun than spending 70% of your time doing paperwork for National Science Foundation grants that can be abolished on a governmental whim halfway through the project? Join me!If you’re a billionaire intrigued by all this: Reach out. So far, this project has run on small grants from theIrish Arts Council;Tyler Cowen’sEmergent Venturesfund;Jim O'Shaughnessy’sO’Shaughnessy Ventures; and the support of paid subscribers. (Plus my, inherently unreliable, publishing royalties to keep us going between grants.) I’d rather not waste so much time chasing funding; I need aMediciwho’s willing to back a remarkably affordable intellectual revolution. (If you’re a Medici in a hurry,the PayPal link is here; if you're not in a hurry, let’s talk.)And if you're not a journalist, a scientist, or a billionaire, just a reader who finds this work exciting?

This breakthrough enables each pixel of an OLED display to simultaneously emit different sounds, essentially allowing the display to function as a multichannel speaker array. The team successfully demonstrated the technology on a 13-inch OLED panel, equivalent to those used in laptops and tablets. The research has been published online in the journalAdvanced Science.Visuals Meet Audio: Toward a Multisensory Display EraWhile display technologies have evolved with significant advances in resolution, high dynamic range, and color accuracy -- particularly with OLEDs and QD-enhanced displays -- the industry now faces the need for breakthroughs that enhance not only image quality but also the realism and immersion of user experience.As visual technologies approach maturity, integrating multisensory inputs -- such as seeing, hearing, and touch -- into displays has become a new frontier. Therefore, now displays are no longer passive panels that simply show images; they are evolving into immersive interfaces that engage multiple human senses. Among these, sound plays a critical role: research indicates that audiovisual synchronization accounts for nearly 90% of perceived immersion.However, most current displays still require external soundbars or multi-channel speakers, which add bulk and create design challenges -- especially in compact environments like vehicle interiors, where integrating multiple speakers is difficult.OLEDs with Built-in Pixel-Based Sound: A Game ChangerTo address this, researchers have focused on integrating advanced sound capabilities directly into OLED panels, known for their slim, flexible form factors. While companies have explored attaching exciters to the back of TVs or bending OLEDs around speakers -- as seen at MWC 2024 by Samsung and OLED panel speaker by LG -- these methods still rely on bulky hardware and face challenges in accurate sound localization.The core issue is that traditional exciters -- devices that vibrate to produce sound -- are large and heavy, making it difficult to deploy multiple units without interference or compromising the OLED's thin design. Additionally, sound crosstalk between multiple speakers leads to a lack of precise control over localized audio.Crosstalk-Free Pixel-Based Local Sound Control integrated with real working OLEDThe POSTECH team overcame these challenges by embedding ultra-thin piezoelectric exciters within the OLED display frame. These piezo exciters, arranged similarly to pixels, convert electrical signals into sound vibrations without occupying external space. Crucially, they are fully compatible with the thin form factor of OLED panels.As a result, each pixel can act as an independent sound source, enabling Pixel-Based Local Sound technology. The researchers also developed a method to completely eliminate sound crosstalk, ensuring that multiple sounds from different regions of the display do not interfere with each other -- something previously unattainable in multichannel setups.Real Applications: Mobile, Tablet, Laptop, TV, Automotive, VR, and BeyondThis innovation allows for truly localized sound experiences. For instance, in a car, the driver could hear navigation instructions while the passenger listens to music -- all from the same screen. In virtual reality or smartphones, spatial sound can dynamically adapt to the user's head or hand movements, enhancing realism and immersion.Most notably, the technology was successfully implemented on a 13-inch OLED panel, proving its practical scalability and commercial viability. The display delivers high-quality audio directly from the screen, without the need for external speakers, all while preserving the slim and lightweight benefits of OLED.A Word from the Researcher\"Displays are evolving beyond visual output devices into comprehensive interfaces that engage both sight and sound,\" said Professor Su Seok Choi. \"This technology has the potential to become a core feature of next-generation devices, enabling sleek, lightweight designs in smartphones, laptops, and automotive displays -- while delivering immersive, high-fidelity audio.\"Funding AcknowledgmentThis research was supported by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy under the Electronic Components Technology Innovation Program and the Graduate Program in Semiconductor Materials and Devices at POSTECHKey Highlights:POSTECH developed the world's first Pixel-Based Local Sound OLED, where each pixel emits distinct sound.The display integrates ultra-thin piezo exciters to achieve crosstalk-free multichannel audio.Proven on a Real 13-inch OLED panel, the technology enables immersive sound directly from the screen -- no external speakers needed.Opens new possibilities for automotive, VR, and mobile displays with slim, high-quality built-in soundRELATED TOPICSMatter & EnergyAcousticsTechnologyEngineering and ConstructionConsumer ElectronicsComputers & MathComputer GraphicsSpintronics ResearchMobile ComputingEducational TechnologyRELATED TERMSAcousticsFireworksComputer and video gamesLocal area networkSound effectTechnologyComputer simulationMechanicsStory Source:Materialsprovided byPohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH).Note: Content may be edited for style and length.Journal Reference:Inpyo Hong, Su Seok Choi.Localized Sound‐Integrated Display Speaker Using Crosstalk‐Free Piezoelectric Vibration Array.Advanced Science, 2025; DOI:10.1002/advs.202414691Cite This Page:MLAAPAChicagoPohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH). \"High-quality OLED displays now enabling integrated thin and multichannel audio.\" ScienceDaily.

Credit: Chimbo Foundation.A recent study by behavioral biologists from Wageningen University & Research and the German Primate Research Center has uncovered a remarkable phenomenon among wild chimpanzees in West Africa: the use of stones to produce sound, presumably as a form of communication.Over the course of a five-year field study, the research team collectedvideo footageat five distinct locations within anature reservein Guinea-Bissau. This was made possible through the use of camera traps and with essential support from local field guides. In specific areas, a striking behavioral pattern was observed: adult male chimpanzees repeatedly struck stones againsttree trunks, resulting in characteristic piles of stones at the base of these trees.The study ispublishedin the journalBiology Letters.Lead author Sem van Loon refers to this behavior as \"stone-assisted drumming.\" \"It appears to be related to the classic drumming with hands or feet on hollow buttress roots, which chimpanzees use to convey information over long distances or to display dominance,\" she explains.Yet there are clear differences: prior to throwing stones, the animals are more likely to emit loud pant-hoots, followed by silence—an opposite pattern to traditional drumming, where silence typically precedes the noise.Van Loon suspects a different motivation behind this behavior. \"It may be that these loud, low-frequency sounds are meant to carry further than typical within-group communication,\" she suggests. \"The acoustic properties of a stone striking a tree make that feasible in densely forested areas.\"The observations point to cultural transmission. Young chimpanzees adopt the behavior from older group members, indicating that it is learned socially rather than genetically inherited.Marc Naguib, Professor of Behavioral Ecology, underscores the broader significance of the discovery: \"It illustrates that culture is not unique to humans and that such behaviors need to be considered also in nature conservation.\"More information:Sem van Loon et al, Stone-assisted drumming in Western chimpanzees and its implications for communication and cultural transmission,Biology Letters(2025).DOI: 10.1098/rsbl.2025.0053Journal information:Biology LettersProvided byWageningen UniversityCitation: Five-year study suggests chimpanzees strike stones against trees as form of communication (2025, May 26) retrieved 29 May 2025 from https://phys.org/news/2025-05-year-chimpanzees-stones-trees-communication.htmlThis document is subject to copyright.

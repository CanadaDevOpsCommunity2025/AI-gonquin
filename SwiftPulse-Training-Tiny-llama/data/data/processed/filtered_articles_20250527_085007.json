Since then, The Browser Company has been issuing bug fixes and security updates to Arc, but has stopped developing the app and adding features to it.Ina new blog post, the companys CEO, Josh Miller, said Arc browser ran into a novelty tax problem.For most people, Arc was simply too different, with too many new things to learn, for too little reward [] On top of that, Arc lacked cohesion in both its core features and core values. It was experimental, that was part of its charm, but also its complexity, Miller wrote.The Browser Company doesnt plan to shut down Arc completely, but it said it has considered selling it or open-sourcing it. However, Miller said the challenge in open-sourcing the browser is that it is built on top of the Arc Development Kit, an internal SDK, which is also the core component of its new browser Dia, and it wouldnt want to give away that IP.While wed love to open-source Arc someday, we cant do that meaningfully without also open-sourcing ADK. And ADK is still core to our companys value. That doesnt mean itll never happen, Miller said.Notably,manyArc Browserusershave been asking the company to turn it into an open-source project.Techcrunch eventJoin us at TechCrunch Sessions: AISecure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The tech industry isnt actually shrinking; instead, tech roles are spreading across all industries, from healthcare to finance to retail. Recent research shows tech jobs are projected to grow from 6 million this year to 7.1 million by 2034.

One owner, who bought a 100,000 AWD 2024 model and accumulated 19,623 miles, received a quote for 63,100 (a 37 depreciation); the other purchased a top-of-the-line 127,000 Cyberbeast last September and was shown a quote for 78,200, which would amount to a 38 loss after eight months.Tesla initiallybanned ownersfrom reselling the vehicle  a policy typically used to prevent scalping of high-demand vehicles and to maintain brand control. In Teslas case, it may also have delayed a wave of trade-ins or resales from owners facing a backlash owing to Elon Musks high profile in the Trump administration or frustrated with ongoingquality controlissues, which have included runaway gas pedals and falling trim pieces.Worth noting: trade-in figures are typically lower than private-party sales, and EVs as a category depreciate fast.

Just look at what happened to Cruise, Zooxs erstwhile competitor. The GM-backed company saw its business crumble after one of its robotaxis struck a pedestrian that was flung into its path by a human-driven vehicle, and thendragged that pedestrian some 20 feetwhile attempting a pullover maneuver.TechCrunch has reached out to learn if this was a top-of-mind concern for Zoox when it issued its software recall, or whether there were other factors at play, like unexpected hard braking.In March,Zoox recalled 258 vehiclesdue to issues with its autonomous driving system that could cause unexpected hard braking, following two reports of incidents in which motorcyclists collided into the back of Zoox test vehicles.Zoox did not respond in time to TechCrunch to confirm more details about its latest software recall, including how many vehicles were affected, and how this update is different from the update issued several weeks ago.TechCrunch has reached out to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for more information on the recall."

Netflix remains available on all other Fire TV devices.Lurey Ridings specified that Netflix wont be supported on the first-generation models of Fire TV, Fire TV Stick, and Fire TV Stick with Voice Remote. They also confirmed that people who have those devices may be eligible for a discount on a newer Fire TV Stick and can contact customer service for more information.If you didnt get the email but want to check whether your Fire TV device is one of those losing Netflix support, the outlet writes that you can look in the About section under Settings  My Fire TV.Netflixs email reportedly doesnt say why it is cutting off the devices. But in a FAQ added to aNetflix help pagesometime in the last couple of months (March 15th is when itfirst showed upon The Internet Archive), the company indicates it may deprecate its app for devices that can no longer get necessary updates from its manufacturer or support new features.

Scientists have a nickname for these structures: galactic bones. Recently, astronomers found that one of the Milky Ways bones is fractured, and they believe theyve now found a possible culprit: a neutron star that may have collided with it.According to NASA, these bones are huge elongated formations of energized particles that spiral along magnetic fields running through the galaxy. The particles release radio waves, and so are detectable using radio telescopes.Scientists have found several such bones in the galaxy, but one of the most striking is called G359.13142-0.20005, also known as the Snake. It is a 230-light-year-long filament that appears to have a fracture. It is also one of the brightest. One of the first explanations was that some as yet undetected body had disturbed the filament.A study by Harvard University, published in the journalMonthly Notice of the Royal Astronomical Society, set out to test this hypothesis. The research team involved found signs of a pulsar, a neutron star spinning at high speed, in the same region as the broken bone. These stars are extremely dense, and are the small remnants left after the explosion of a supermassive star.Using NASAsChandra X-ray Observatory, which orbits Earth, along with theMeerKATtelescope array in South Africa and theVery Large Arrayin New Mexicotwo systems that detect radio wavesscientists found what appear to be traces of a pulsar in the filament. Based on data from these observatories, they estimate that this pulsar impacted the bone at a speed of between 1,609,000 and 3,218,000 kilometers per hour. The suspected collision is thought to have distorted the magnetic field of the bone, causing its radio signal to deform.The structure G359.13, with the fracture visible on its right-hand side.Photograph: NASACXCNorthwestern UniversityIn the above image provided by NASA, the Snake can be seen, and there is a body that appears to be interacting with the structure, in the middle of its length. It is possibly the aforementioned neutron star.Pulsars are alternative versions of a neutron star where, in addition to being compact objects, they rotate at high velocities and produce strong magnetic fields. At the moment there is no instrument that can see them directly due to their size and distance, but radio telescopes can detect the electromagnetic waves they emit and hear them by converting these into sound.This story originally appeared onWIREDen Españoland has been translated from Spanish."

Fujifilm recentlypausedUS preorders for several models including the X-M5 and X100 VI.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementOther electronics companies, includingAcerandDJI, also recently announced US-only price hikes. In its latest earnings report, Sony said it expects to seller fewer PS5s and expects a 700 million tariff-related revenue hit.These increases could just be the beginning. Nikon builds its products inmultiple countriesaffected by US tariffs, including China, Thailand and its home country, Japan. Unless those nations can negotiate new tariff terms before the end of Trump's90-day pause, they could be subject to drastically higher rates by July  which would in turn prices for Nikon and many other camera manufacturers."

You can argue over it's portability — the Move 2 makes more sense as something your carry to your backyard than take on a hike — but the speaker packs a punch and lets you play music over both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

Anastasia, aka Stasia, Miller seems to have missed that memo. The main character of Mira Grant'sOvergrowthis an infiltrator from a race of plant-like aliens who came to Earth as a seed, stole the body of 3-year-old Anastasia and has been living as her ever since. And that's pretty much how she introduces herself to everyone she meets. Most people don't believe her, and she lives a relatively normal life. She grows up to be somewhat awkward and, fittingly, is obsessed withLittle Shop of Horrors, but has a couple of good friends, a supportive partner and a pet cat (Seymour, of course), who she adores. Aliens, they're just like us.Everything is flipped on its head when a scientist detects an extraterrestrial signal and Stasia recognizes it as the sign that her people have finally come to launch the full-scale invasion she's always been warning of.Overgrowthis a thrilling sci-fi horror story that's also at times lighthearted and funny.

In this series, millions of vampires have suddenly stepped out of the shadows and launched an attack on humankind. They've wiped out pretty much everyone everywhere  except the Vatican, where something extremely important to them is buried deep beneath the holy city.The first two issues see a group of survivors trying to hold off the vampire siege of the Vatican. It's short, violent and exhilarating, making for a quick, fun read that's not that deep and doesn't need to be. The final issue comes out June 18.4 at Amazon"
